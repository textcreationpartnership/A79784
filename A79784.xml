         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT often happens in Books what ſomtime in Children, that although obſcurely born, they are by the benigne aſpect of ſome great Perſon hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily caſt upon them, entertained and bred up in princely palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and flouriſh as much by hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py chance, as they could have don by a greater birth. I wiſh with all my heart that this little Off-ſpring of mine, which coms running with a modeſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the feet of your glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:121335:3"/>Vertues, which have only moved it to ſuch a boldnes, may find favour in your eyes: ſo that incouraged by the greatneſs of your Name, it may chearfully go in and out conſpicuous in the world, and do the good my heart deſireth. To the end it may bear with it ſome poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of acceptance both, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, with your Honour and with the world too, I have to my power imprinted upon its forehead the general lineaments of noblenes, Reaſon and Civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. But other Ornaments are ſo far wanting, that it may not expect entertainment, but where ſom great part of that Goodnes which hath rendred the <hi>Counteſs
<pb facs="tcp:121335:3"/>of Arundel</hi> ſo renowned and gracious may inhabite.</p>
            <p>The Book carries no other intent but what a Perſon of Honour may own: and its pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos written upon its face an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers directly to its heart and ſpirit. It would for ſooth pacifie our rurall diſtempers about af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Religion, and ſhowes a Light that Madnes may ſee what it does, where it miſtakes, and how irrationally it rages. This is the very end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos of my Book, laudable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough I may preſume, and not unworthy the Countenance of Honour, were it accompliſhed with that art ſo good a purpos requireth.

               <hi>FIAT LUX.</hi> Preface. The motive, matter, and method of the Book.</head>
            <p>THeſe twenty years of inteſtin wars and broils principally if not ſolely upon the account of Religion being now paſt, and the tempeſt ceaſed upon the return of our great Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot to whom ſuch winds and ſeas ought to obey, unto the government of his ſhip out of which our unruly paſſion caſt him to our own great ſhame and ruin, it is now high time for us to lay our hand upon our heart and be ſober.</p>
            <p>An irregular fire of zeal, a meteor-lanthorn hath led us into lakes and precipices and there left us. But God forbid that for the time to com we ſhould any of us by ſuch deceitfull lights be any more miſled. And this that we may all heed, as it is the earneſt deſire of all good Chriſtian ſpirits; ſo is it the onely ſcope and endeavour of this little book, which I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly offer and preſent unto the hands of my Countrimen, eſpecially the gentler and more
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:121335:7"/>refined natures of whoſe favourable acceptance I do conceiv greater hopes than from any vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar eye, which expecting to read the old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon places they are fore-acquainted with, &amp; in the uſual tract and method, will I fear when they miſs here of both, like of nothing. But gentlemen by the highnes of birth and greatnes of their education have put on other affections, and do ſomtimes more heed a plain rationall diſcours unto a commendable end, though deſtitute of all guard but its own ſingle reaſon, than the ordinary large retinue of autorities and texts which may indeed much ſtrengthen and adorn a book, but hinder a reader in his progres; and generally they diſlike any new book that differs no otherwiſe from former ones, than a new moon from an old one.</p>
            <p>Theſe paſt times between 1640. and 1660. and the horrour of them, wherin we were afraid even to think, and that in our private cloſets, I intend not here to ſpeak of; for poſterity, ſhould I write true and fully, would never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev it; and if fals or imperfectly, the preſent age eywitnes of the truth would ſlight it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides I would not willingly now offend any whom I have been aforetime ſo hugely afraid of. Charity alſo towards my neighbour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades me, that the long Parliament and all their adherents had an appearance of ſom great good before their eyes, which they were not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:121335:7"/>able to wield: for when they had all under their feet that might any waies oppoſe or bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their deſign, yet could they never bring to paſs any of the ſpetious things they made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens of, the great welfar of our Kingdom, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of a pure religion, liberty of conſcience, and freedom of the ſubject; unto all which their actions were ſo contrary all theſe twenty years together, that man could not diſcern by their doings that they did ſo much as mean any ſuch thing; whether it were that they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed never ſincerely intend, or were not able to compas, or by ſeverall concurrencies of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs were diverted and jusled from that end un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to waies utterly oppoſite both to our good and their own too.</p>
            <p>I was ever of opinion all the while, that the account of Religion as the caſe ſtands needed not of all other things ſo highly to incens us one againſt another unto ſuch injurious outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as paſt amongſt us; and found in my heart ſeveral times to put pen to paper and utter my minde; but I was retarded by the two reaſons of my own ſmall ability, and my Countries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition at that time to ſuch diſcours. But now people ſeem more calmly diſpoſed, and my ſelf ſomwhat bettered by reading more books of Quakers, Anabaptiſts, Presbyterians, and by the ſociety of theſe and ſeverall others, Wel-willers, Seekers, Atheiſts, Philoſophers. The
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:121335:8"/>books of Roman Catholicks I had peruſed and digeſted a forehand: our Proteſtant Religion I underſtood long ago being born and bred in that way. So that an exact knowledg of all I am to ſpeak, together with my long obſerving experience will I hope ſomwhat ſupply my other wants,</p>
            <p>One thing incourages me not a little to this enterprize; which is that I have frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that it is not alwaies a muchnes either of eloquence learning or wiſdom, that ſtrikes a ſtroke in aſſwaging differences, or makes a right underſtanding between parties, but ſuch a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den caus ſomtims in the words and geſtures of perſons, as we may rather call it chance than any thing elſe. I have my ſelf pacified neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, even in their hotteſt diſſentions, when others of greater wiſdom and acquaintance have prevailed leſs. So that I have thereupon concluded that theſe kind of feudes againſt charity may have in them ſomwhat of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the tarantulaes ſtingings, which be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not by the beſt muſick but the fitteſt.</p>
            <p>Another thing I muſt adde, that I never yet heard of any that ſo much as endeavoured to allay our religious diſtempers by the generall lights I go upon: without which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one will remain ſo fixed in his own way, that little good can be wrought; as by daily experience we finde it true. The Prince of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:121335:8"/>all to picks in the alaying of theſe kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtions is that of Virgil— <hi>Sed motos praeſtat componere fluctus.</hi> Controverſies be written on this ſide and that, invective defiances made on all ſides without end, confutations of Sects bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough every where, objections and replies endles, ſome for Papiſts ſome againſt them, ſome againſt our Proteſtants ſome for them; ſome by Presbyterians ſome by Anabaptiſts; ſome by Quakers againſt all, ſome by all ſorts againſt the Quakers. But all theſe kind of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes be ſo far from quenching, that they adde ſtill more fewel to the fire, and make it both to flame more vehement and laſt longer and ſpread farther; whiles every one remains ſo inveigled and addicted to his own way, that he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates all the reſt, and cannot let fall a good word for any, or acknowledge a truth in them: but Popery, the devill of Popery we are ſo tranſported with the hatred of it, that we could tear it in pieces with our teeth. My diſlike therfore of ſuch miſtakes and ungrounded ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and the love I bear to a right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing urge me to attempt, what I ſee in this way no others go about, a mitigation of groundles but dangerous animoſities. I had the very ſame good purpoſ when I wrote the <hi>Reclaimed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,</hi> but Satan hindered me in that: and I am reſolved now once again for the good of my Countrey which I dearly love, to try if I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:121335:9"/>can compas it another way.</p>
            <p>But I am finally inflamed to this work by a ſight of his Majeſties moſt gracious Speech, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Lord Chancellors, unto the two houſes of Parliament upon their adjournment in <hi>September</hi> 1660. where one may evidently ſee our Sovereigns moſt earneſt and even groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſire of a moderate and prudent comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this Land one of us towards another according to the dictamen of our Chriſtianity and right reaſon in theſe matters of Religion, together with a promis of his utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to our generall ſatisfaction, if we in the interim could but have charity one towards an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other till he may underſtand how to pleaſe us all. Could wiſdom and goodnes it ſelf deſire ought of us, that might either be more facil or rationall or more pleaſing than that we ſhould be good to our ſelves. And who would not endeavour to his power what he ſees ſo great a Prince deſires, as a thing neceſſary to the welfar of our Land, which for want of this moderation hath been lately ſo miſerably haraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and undone.</p>
            <p>My Lord Chancellors words upon his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties ſuggeſtion are theſe. <hi>There are two other particulars which I am commanded to mention, which were both mentioned and commended unto you by his Majeſty in his declaration from Breda; the one for confirmation of ſales or other recompens
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:121335:9"/>for purchaſes, the other for the compoſing of thoſe differences and diſtempers in Religion, which have too much diſturbed the peace of the Kingdom. Two very weighty particulars, &amp;c. For the firſt his Majeſty hath not been without much thought, &amp;c. the other of Religion is a ſad argument indeed. It is a conſideration that muſt make every religious heart to bleed, to ſee religion which ſhould be the ſtrongeſt obligation and ciment to affection and brotherly kindnes and compaſſion, made now by the pervers wranglings: of paſſionate and froward men the ground of all animoſity hatred malice and revenge. And this unruly and unmanly paſſion which no queſtion but the divine nature exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly abhorres ſomtimes and I fear too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſports thoſe who are in the right as thoſe who are in the wrong, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe be the learned Chancellors words (ſet down more at large in the laſt § of my book) ſo grave diſcreet and patheticall, that if they were ſeriouſly pondered as they deſerv, might ſuffice to put us to a ſtand even in the higheſt carreer of our moſt uncharitable animoſities upon Religions account. How many waies does the honourable Oratour turn himſelf to move us to our own welfar; how wiſely does he ſelect his to picks, how ſweetly unites, how vigorouſly preſſes, <hi>ab eſſentialibus, ab effectibus, à contrariis, ab inconvenientibus, à diſſimilibus, &amp;c.</hi> to this effect;</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:121335:10"/>
            <p>Religion is the ciment of affection; muſt or can that be the ground of malice? Surely that is an evil paſſion, by what ever name it be intitled, that tranſports as well thoſe that are in the right as thoſe that are in the wrong unto effects in every right judgement injurious and hatefull to the divine nature. Not ſtrangers, but allies and friends, and men otherwis of moſt agreeable natures, under this colour of religion and by it, becom firſt unſociable then uncharitable; firſt half friends then full foes, not for any harm either of word or deed, but only a diſparity of thoughts, ſuch thoughts too as concern not one another, but onely paſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt man and his maker; nor is it becaus one man will not, but becaus he cannot think as another doth. And God himſelf muſt patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nise theſe our uncharitable diviſions, whiles purely for his ſake we hate one another hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: we hate even to death ſuch as otherwis be our deareſt friends, for his ſake and upon his account who commands us to love our enemies; and enmitie is our utmoſt profeſſion in the mannaging of his Religion, who told us himſelf that the fulfilling of his whole law is Love. The primitive Chriſtians were in all judgments good ones; and yet their badge and practis quite contrary to ours: theirs was love and peace even to the admiration of their enemies, ours hatred and war even to the confuſion of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:121335:10"/>our friends; they died for, we by one another; they by the vertue of their Religion cimented together who before by affection and blood ſtood far divided, we by ours do ſeparate in all we were before conjoined; theirs made new friendſhip, ours diſſolves the old. But when the honourable Lord Chancellour addes in the cloſe. <hi>This diſquiſition hath coſt the King many a ſigh many a ſad-hour:</hi> What honeſt heart would not at that word be ready to burſt aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? Is that great princely innocence contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtated by my ſelf ruinous diſorder? Far be it from me to ſadden that roiall breaſt, in which the Almighty ſits and ſwaies over me for my good.</p>
            <p>My Reader be pleaſed to underſtand that I intend not directly in this my dicours, to juſtifie or judg any opinion, but only to ſhow that wars and enmities upon ſuch an account be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween neighbours is neither pious nor rationall. But the acroamatick part which would prove our contentions about Religion to be irrationall fills up the book; the moral which ſhowes them to be unconformable to true piety and vertue is compendiouſly finiſhed in the concluding para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graff. And if I do let fall words that may fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour any one opinion or way more than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; it is only for this end, that I may therby allay the heats of the other ſide which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperatly ſet againſt it more then any elſe;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:121335:11"/>if to depreſs any, it is to abate the exceſſive both conceit we have of it and faction for it without any juſt caus: that ſo the oppreſſed may be a little eaſed and raiſed up, and the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor checkt by his own conſcience; which is the only way of introducing equallity of thoughts and unanimity amongſt us. And when we are once perſwaded to think more moderately of that ſide we have hitherto hated, and to diſcern ſom uncertainty in the other we ſo much doted of; ſo that our affection may riſe where before it was too low, and where it was too high there begin to fall, and that a ſmoothnes and equabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may appear once in us, then we ſhall be pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well diſpoſed to a right underſtanding and peace. St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> the great precurſor of the worlds <hi>Meſſias,</hi> whoſe office was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare mankind to receiv him, had nothing els to do for that purpos but only this very thing; as if this kind of ſmoothnes and equability in mens affections were the beſt and only prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration unto the grace and peace of Jeſus Chriſt within us. <hi>The voice of a Crier in the deſert</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaias, prepare the way of our Lord, make the waies level, every valley ſhall be raiſed up, and every mountain and hill ſhall be brought down, and crooked things ſhall become ſtraight, and rough make ſmooth, and then all fleſh ſhall ſee the ſalvation of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My matter is perceived by the prefixed gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

                  <item>5. As there neither is nor can be any rationall motive for diſputes and animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties about matters of Religion; ſo is there an indiſpenſable morall caus obliging us unto mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, if we either conſider the various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities of hatred and rancour, or the large ſweetnes and convenience of charity and peace.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>My method I do purpoſely conceal, to keep therin a more handſom decorum; for he that goes about to part a fighting fray cannot obſerv a method, but muſt turn himſelf this way and that, as occaſion offers, be it a corporal or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal duel. So did good St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which of all his other letters as it hath in it moſt of ſolidity, ſo hath it leaſt of method in the context. The reaſon is, becaus
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:121335:12"/>it was intended to allay ſom heats and feudes that were riſen in <hi>Rome</hi> amongſt the converted Jews and Gentiles there, who began after their converſion to upbraid and diſable one another (as ſuch childiſh heats will riſe) with their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer unworthines. The converted Jew eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf the better man, becaus his Nation was Gods choſen from the beginning, out of which the Meſſias came, and the Jews were in a continuall ſucceſſion both before their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Chriſtianity and after it, ſtill Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. The converted Gentile on the other ſide maintained, that he had notwithſtanding the darkneſs of his condition ſo worthily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf even by the meer light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that God was pleaſed of his love he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bore him to call him to the light of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to ſerv that Lord of glory whom the Jews had crucified. S. <hi>Paul</hi> to end this quarrell turns himſelf to and fro, firſt on this ſide, then on the other, as occaſion preſented it ſelf; and finding the parties reſolute in a queſtion hard to decide as it was ſtated, and both ſo deeply inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that they could not eaſily be reconciled, that he might the better part them he knocks them both down; and he diſſipates all pretenſes of their own worthines, to the end they might both of them have recours to Gods mercy which was equally ſhewed to both, and ſo have peace among them ſelves.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:121335:12"/>
            <p>This is the occaſion and end and ſumm of that Epiſtle; which it ſeems our Miniſters ſom of them do not underſtand, otherwis they would not cull out of it ſo many various texts againſt the Chriſtian doctrin of good works and their merit, ſo abſolutely impertinent to that purpoſe, that I cannot but be aſhamed to ſee grave men to defend the caus ſo frivolouſly. the works, whoſe merit S. <hi>Paul</hi> diſables there, were apparently ſuch as were don before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, of which the abettours would have thoſe works to be the caus, works acted in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſme and Paganisme, without Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance of his grace, without his command, without his promis of reward for them, end conſequently without any accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes they might have upon thoſe grounds. But what is all this to the diſabling of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an good works, don in Chriſt, by his ſpeciall grace, out of obedience to his command, with a promis of everlaſting reward, and intrinſick acceptability thence accrewing. Look if Goſpel do not make out Chriſtian merit in this point; ſee if do no clearly ſpeak forth both Chriſts word commanding, his grace aſſiſting, his love accepting, and the riches of his goodnes crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſuch good works don in him for his love with eternal reward. <hi>Come ye bleſſed for I was hungry, &amp;c.</hi> But this only by the way.</p>
            <p>The occaſion then of that ſacred epiſtle being
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:121335:13"/>manifeſtly to make peace between two ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling barrettours, as it required a great judgment and ſpirit in the author to write it well, ſo could it admit but little of method in its progres. And a man may eaſily diſcern that the Apoſtle turns himſelf now againſt the Jew, then ſodainly againſt the Gentile, then to the Jew again; ſtill diſabling all the utmoſt they could either of them do, or pretend to do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their converſion, as any way of ability and power to merit either it, or the grace and life they had by it. And it is to be noted too, that wheras the Jew had three times more of plauſibility on his ſide than the Gentile had, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks leaſt againſt him that was the weakeſt ſide and moſt oppreſſed; but where he checks the Gentile once, he rebukes the Jew three times: and never lins till he had laid his inſulting in the duſt. So proper it is to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous nature to withold the ſtrong domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering party, that the weaker and oppreſſed may gather a little heart, and diſcern himſelf at leaſt in as good a poſtur as his antagoniſt. Now my purpos ſith it is very like that of the good Apoſtles, I ſhall not I hope be blamed for imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating ſo great a Doctour in his method.</p>
            <p>And although to every one of my five cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters I do adjoin ſom generall contents, as I have ſaid; yet are they not to be looked upon as confined to that place, but that other matters
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:121335:13"/>will in each chapter and its ſeverall paragraffs occurr; and alſo thoſe very contents be elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where hinted at: for I do intermingle my to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, according as they ſeemed at any time conducing to the right underſtanding I aim at; which I have don on purpos to keep up the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and refreſh it with variety: So in taſts an <hi>olla</hi> hath that good relliſh, which all the things contained in it without that generall mixture and ſeaſoning would never have apart. My Reader will ſee alſo, that ſomthings are but ſlightly touched, which he would think ought to have been more ſeriouſly proſecuted; ſom again he will imagin too prolix, others too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to appear and too ſodainly to vaniſh, like <hi>Virgills</hi> ghoſt. <hi>Omnibus vmbra locis adero:</hi> and all ſo interwoven, that in one paragraff it can hardly be gueſſed what is to be handled in the next. Theſe and other ſuch things which many may diſlike I have a reaſon for; and I hope my reader whoſe profit and pleaſur I only wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will give me leav to uſe it: A ſeaſonable gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle air invites men abroad whom a ſtrong wind would have kept within doors; and I hope this my familiar diſcours may move many of my countrimen who would not have looked upon ſolid and ſtudied controverſies, to read and perhaps recover that good diſpoſition of mind I wiſh them, even with their own pleaſur and good liking. Our land this laſt twenty years
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:121335:14"/>hath been in a chaos of confuſion, a Tohu and Bohu, without either form or order, and we all find our ſelves in a miſt, in a wood, in a dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes almoſt invincible by our ſeverall diviſions and ſubdiviſions of parties in the way of Faith. But I hope, that by the help of this Diſcours which is intended as a generall light unto all Books, Sermons, or Controverſies wherby peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are drawn into ſo many ſeverall diſtracting opinions, we ſhall find the way out at leaſt know where we are: My order and phraſe be ſuited to the preſent times, but the matter and purpos concealed in it of a laſting concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>Qui legit intelligat.</hi> This is all I have to prefate, and I wiſh no more but truth and peace to all and to the whole Iſrael of God.</p>

                  <p>THe applaus and honour of this world is a thing deſired and pleaſing to all perſons, from the Prince in the court to the Peaſant in the cottage; even as wealth and place by which it is atchieved. Nor is there one of a thouſand that follows not the inclination, to the end be may attain it in that degree his condition is capable: and they get it ſom by chance of birth and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſom by induſtry and worth, ſom by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty and wit. Hence proceed thoſe many high attempts we ſo much wonder at in this world, (for arts and trades began at firſt through a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of food, and the conveniency we found
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:121335:15"/>in mutuall ſociety) ſuch attempts I mean as were apt to lead the vulgar into a fit of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; as be the two great excellencies of power and knowledg, and their great atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that for defence of laws and kingdoms, this for the adornment of nations and purer pleaſurs of more refined intellects. And both of theſe have many branches and kinds, and each hath a diverſity of graduall perfections. He that cannot ſway a Province, will tiranniſe in his Pariſh, and if he cannot appear abroad, will domineere in his own hous: ſo likewiſe on the other ſide, what glory the emulous Plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſees given to higher ſpirits for ſciences they cannot reach, or for a ſuperviſorſhip of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion they may not hope for, this by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the one and reformation of the other do they go about to compas in the world, firſt by words and pen (if they can write) then, if they multiply and grow ſtrong enough, by rude force and violence: and ſtill the pretens for all is cleanly and fair waſhed over; that applaus and glory may both accompany ſtrengthen and crown the deſign.</p>
                  <p>What ſtrang things have been attempted by emperours and great captains and commanders upon earth all hiſtories make mention, and it is a pleaſant ſpeculation to conſider it. But the method and ſeverall wais of enhancing fame by inventions and diſcoveries of truths proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:121335:15"/>by contemplativ heads, what and how vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous they have been in the Pagan world, we may in part gather out of <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato, Lucreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, M. Tullius Cicero,</hi> and ſom other few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents yet kept amongſt us. What they have been in the Chriſtian world lives more freſh in our memories: but theſe are of two ſorts; one in explication and defens of faith againſt all oppoſition poſſible to be made by any kind of adverſaries, Jew, Heretick, or Pagan; and this hath been the emploiment of the moſt ſublime eagles that ever the Chriſtian Church had, S. Auſtin, Magiſter ſententiarum, Alenſis, S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aquinas, Bonaventure, Gandavenſis, Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, and the like: The other in oppoſition to faith, which roſe up in ſeverall ages for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of this myſtick Body who was in his own perſon not onely oppoſed by outward adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries but deſerted by his own.</p>
                  <p>I love thoſe eminent Pagan wits: and this commendation they have that they are our firſt maſters in all our Sciences; that they perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what they undertook to write moſt ſolidly acutely and exactly both for judgment clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and method; and thirdly that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed one another (for they were divided in opinions as well as we, and it was expedient they ſhould be ſo) not in reviling words, as we Chriſtians do, but in ſober and pureſt reaſon; although the arguments of their diſcours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:121335:16"/>ſomtimes very little to the confutation of an adverſary, becaus they often proceeded upon ſeverall principles not ever rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, or at leaſt for more particular advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage wilfully miſtaken.</p>
                  <p>And in this method of ſobriety do our two great Schollers the Lawyer and Phyſician write, when they put forth treatiſes either one body of art againſt another, or one member and perſon in particular againſt another in the ſame body: So likewiſe did our ſubtile Schoolmen proceed five hundred years ago, with no leſſe ſweetnes of ſpirit than profundnes of reaſon; whoſe intention was to explicate and defend Chriſtianity even in the way of Ariſtotles Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, by which the Pagans had for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Theſe Schoolmen divided into divers branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es by occaſion of a ſeverall interpretation of Ariſtotle, either in the way of S. Thomas of Aquin the Dominican, whoſe doctrine for the moſt part was followed in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> or of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:121335:16"/>ſubtile Scotus the Franciſcan whoſe chair was at Oxford. And in other parts of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world they had their chairs erected accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either as chance or favour pleaſed. But all was then don with no leſs exact charity than ſublime reaſon: for they had nothing els to do in their Schools, but onely by argument and diſputation to try the grounds and ſolutions, whether if a Pagan himſelf or others antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt whoſe perſon every opponent repreſents, ſhould diſpute againſt them, they could then be able to come off in their defenſions with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaus and honour and without prejudice of their Faith.</p>
                  <p>But when we come to view the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite judgments in matters of religion common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called hereſies, eſpecially in this laſt age, (for the reſt before theſe daies have periſhed by the prevalency of one party againſt which all the reſt bandied together) as theſe be very groſs and homly diſputes ſo are they mannaged on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents ſide with ſo much unſeemly behaviour, ſuch unmanly expreſſions, that diſcreet ſobriety cannot but loath and abhorr to read them. Not reaſon but defiances, not charity but execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not ſubtilties but downright defamations, not civil reſpect but vileſt diſeſteem, not cool perſwaſion but precipitous condemnation fills each page we look on, and fire and ſtones fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout where meeknes peace and charity ſhould moſt appear.</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:121335:17"/>
                  <p>And all theſe religion-diſputes whether we conſider the ſubject they are about, or the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they are handled, or the diſtracting variety into which they run concerning faith revealed (which can be but one) I do not ſee what other effect they can hav upon mankind but to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert all civill reſpect and charity, and good manners, and laws and kingdoms where they come. For no man is content if he pretend to have diſcovered a new way of religion, unleſs all other men embrace it, and preſs and pulpit muſt ring with loud cries againſt all that do not be they neighbours or ſuperiours, untill the ſword it ſelf be ſharpened in our hands for bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Thus beginning with the ſpirit we end with the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>It is not my meaning to interpoſe in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular controverſy whoſe multitude hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made the world to nauſeate, but to hold up my diſcours in ſuch generall tearmes, as I ſhall think may ſerve, if we lay our hands upon our heart, and ponder them with a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſeriouſnes, ſo many of us as be now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably bent againſt our neighbour, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to allay and mitigate the many flaming heats of diſcord raging here in <hi>England,</hi> as much or rather more than any other countrey for opinions concerning faith; which as they are taken up at firſt upon ſelf-conceit inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt as experience hath ſufficiently ſhown, ſo
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:121335:17"/>are they upon all rules of Chriſtian vertue and prudence if we ever mean to be happy, to be depoſed. Be not <hi>many</hi> maiſters, for where all would ſway there none obay, and ſo ruin and miſchief muſt needs follow.</p>
                  <p>The difficultie is, I know not how to expreſs the parties in this religion-feud, that I may not offend: for ſo bitterly is each ſide bent againſt the other, that they will not endure to have them called by their own names. But I notwithſtanding ſhould deem it not only a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility but a due debt ſo to do; for that is every ones name by which himſelf will be called, and not what an enemy gives him. The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant is ſuch a one, and ſo to be named, though his foe on one ſide ſirname him Papiſt, and his adverſary on the other call him heretick; ſo the Catholick likewis by his junior foe is called Papiſt, by his elder enemy, a <hi>Galilean;</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho he may if he will, yet do not think him bound to anſwer either to that appellation or this, and therfore if I behave my ſelf civilly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, I can uſe neither.</p>
                  <p>And as it is for nomination of perſons; ſo likewis for the verities of their opinions, no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will endure that any one truth of the other ſide ſhould be acknowledged, and he that ſhall do it will be looked upon as a common enemy by the reſt: Inſomuch danger is even ordinary neighbourhood and civility amongſt us, when
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:121335:18"/>theſe feuds are once raiſed. I have known good Proteſtants endangered theſe times of our civill wars for calling their neighbour (of whom they had occaſion to ſpeak) by the name of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, wheras according to the uſual language of the feud he ſhould have ſaid <hi>Papiſt.</hi> So ſtrangly are we incenſed in theſe matters. Even our good nature is changed: for Engliſhmen have been thought in the opinion even of forreign nations the faireſt conditioned and beſt natured people in <hi>Europe,</hi> wheras now theſe religious feuds have made us the very worſt. The Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander, what a kind of man he is by natur it is well enough known; and yet in this piece of prudence and civellity he excels us beyond compare: their towns do often exhibite in one and the ſame ſtreet; here a Jew, there a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, Lutheran, Calviniſt, or Catholick; and yet all theſe convers together without any ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour or miſpriſion at all, heeding without any thought or conſideration of their opinions only the moderation and common honeſty they uſe in their contracts, which if it be good, all is well that concerns neighbours; for the reſt let God judg. And in every hous they ſerv God each one in his own way undeſturbedly, without fear of penal law, danger of pillaging, vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of purſuivant, harrassing of ſouldier, any ill looks or maledictions or heart burnings at all upon that account. This comportment is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:121335:18"/>more manlike, it is more Chriſtian, it is far more gentile and honourable than the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the judgment of any diſcrete ſober man in the world: and yet in all other reſpects that be commendable how far doth the Engliſh-man exceed the Hollander?</p>
                  <p>Witty obſerving travellers have noted that all other Nations beſides ours, can admit of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall opinions or reformations without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding their wits; but we and onely we loos ours; and the teſtimony is too true. Indeed to undermine the place and dignity of ſuch as maintain an old religion or ſcience is a piece of ſome kind of ingeniouſneſs or induſtry; but to do it with rancour diſturbance and ruin, this carries with it neither ingenuity nor any reaſon at all: if the thing be good, by a ſupervening hatred and uncharitablenes the good work is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; if it be ill, the malignity is doubled. But charity covers a multiude of ſins.</p>

                  <p>THe nois and tumults that be in the world are partly about things known, partly about things unknown, accordingly as men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their ſpirits to the one or the other; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and aim of all men in theſe their heats, being in truth, whatever they pretend, (and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:121335:19"/>the pretens is ever coloured over) no other thing but an affectation of power and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny over other men.</p>
                  <p>The known things about which we do ſo much contend, are reduced by a wiſe man unto theſe three heads; concupiſcence of fleſh, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence of eyes, and pride of life; expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by an uſuall metonimy the object by the act: and he addes, that, this is all the world contains, namely in order to the worldly or ſenſual mans deſire: for a worldly temptation muſt needs be one of theſe; and about ſome of theſe is all our worldly emulations conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, the concernment either of our pleaſurs or wealth or honour. Unto <hi>concupiſcence of fleſh</hi> belongs all that is apt to pleas the lower ſenſes of Touch Taſte and Smell; which be verſed in the more tangible employments of nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, vegetation, and generation. To <hi>concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence of the eyes</hi> all that may delight the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſes of ſight and hearing; as gold, ſilver, chains, jewels, coſtly attires, dreſſes, furnitures of rooms, delicious walks and gardenings, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, applaus of men, and the like. To <hi>pride of life,</hi> the things that tickle the inward ſenſes and imagination, as great titles, large retinue, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and command of ſtate, with all worldly ſuperiority. Theſe are the things that inflame mankind to ſo many combuſtions in this world; each man thruſting forward and crowding to be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:121335:19"/>firſt, in that he propoſes to himſelf as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his chief content. The feud began with the world, and will not wholly ceas ſo long as it laſteth in its preſent ſtate of corruption: tho it hath been in ſom times and places much mitigated by vertue of a religion which Jeſus our Lord planted upon earth on very purpos to ſlake this helliſh fire.</p>
                  <p>And it is to be obſerved that the Tempter (as it is recorded by one of the Evangeliſts) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted even the very ſacred Perſon of our Lord himſelf with one of all thes three temptations; according as he thought meet to make chois of ſom one of each, that might beſt correſpond unto ſuch a conceived perſon in thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time and place he either found or put him in. He found him in the deſart hungry; and there, <hi>Command that theſe ſtones be made bread,</hi> as it was a temptation of carnal concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence moſt befitting the time and place, ſo is it of that kind ſuch a one as might ſeem leaſt unbefitting ſuch a perſon, being of all the moſt innocent, eſpecially to a hungry man. Upon the battlements of a high church, in the face of a populous city, who might behold and admire at his miraculous preſervation and ſanctity, <hi>Jacta te deorſum, leap down,</hi> was a temptation belonging to concupiscence of eyes, in order to vulgar applaus; nor would it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo manifeſtly evill to do ſuch a thing in the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:121335:20"/>face of the multitude, who ſeeing his ſafety might look upon him him ever after with greater honour and reſpect, as lord of the very Angels who ſtood about to guard him in ſo dangerous a precipice. In the proſpect of the world, <hi>All theſe things will I give thee,</hi> was a congruous temptation, and clearly pertinent to pride of life; but joined with a condition ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly ſinful, (wheras the two former were but ſuch in leſſer circumſtances, and of them the firſt in the leaſt) <hi>If thou wilt fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip me,</hi> which Satan annexed here, not ſo much out of any hopes he could have to bring that perſon to ſuch a ſin, whole conſtancy he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready tried; as to ſpeak forth and expreſs the ordinary way by which men do generally ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive unto their height of dignities, wealth and honour in this world: they diſſemble, they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice their conſcience, they bow their heads, they fall down and worſhip Satan, and ſo take from him their livery and ſeiſin, their <hi>haec omnia tibi dabo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What heats are raiſed about theſe things in the world betwixt man and man, in city and countrey, ſo thick, ſo general in all places, to ſet down with pen and ink it is impoſſible they be ſo many, and alſo ſuperfluous they be ſo obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And from whence are all theſe wars inteſtin and forreign, domeſtick and civil, perſonal and national, be they not from our concupiſence?
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:121335:20"/>it is not to be denied. And ſo long as there is concupiſence in the world, theſe things will be, or at leaſt a motion towards them. Nor is it my preſent purpos to diſſwade any thing in this kind, after the endeavours of ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſacred perſons, apoſtles, prophets and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, who have both by their example and doctrin endeavoured inceſſantly the eradication of the ſinful weed. But happy is that man in whom the three fold members of concupiſcence are become through his care and induſtry over himſelf either quite dead, or at leaſt expiring; for he only lives, and lives like a man, and is free.</p>
                  <p>The other noiſes (which is the ſubject and matter of this my preſent conſideration) are the many claſhing opinions about God and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: an empty aiery buſineſs as I think ere long will appear, a ghoſtly fight, a skirmiſh of ſhadowes, or horſmen in the clouds: and yet 'tis prodigious to ſpeak what real heart-burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, what deadly rancour it breeds in mens minds, and what a deluge of miſchief it cauſes in the world. It is a thing I have often and deeply conſidered, not without horrour and commiſeration.</p>
                  <p>The reſult of my thoughts herein is thus much: ſurely, there is ſomthing inviſible over man, and ſtronger and more politick than he, that does this contumely to mankinde, that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:121335:21"/>caſts in theſe apples of contention amongſt us, that hiſſes us to war and battle, as waggiſh boyes do dogs in the ſtreet, which being once ſet on tear and devour one another, upon no other cauſe or motive than that impulſion. For how els could it poſſibly come to paſs, that a company of men altogether unknown to one another, in ſeveral places, grabs, conſtitutions; employments, ages, and educations, ſhould all of a ſuddain, no man knows how riſe up con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire and jump together in a conceit before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought of, and to all other men beſides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves improbable, ſo unanimous and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, as to put all to a hazard for its defence and propagation, will or nill the whole world that may diſlike it, with ſuch heat of earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes as is never ſeen to appear in any known good thing. Can this be any thing els, than an impreſſion made upon us by ſom inviſible ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or <hi>doemon;</hi> that by this aiery phantoſme inflames us one againſt another unto our utter worrying and devouring, unto whom our deadly feuds ariſing thereon, may haply give no leſs content and ſport then dogs fighting in the ſtreets to wanton boys that ſet them on. This we may ſuſpect at leaſt; and if we do, methinks it ſhould make our pens and weapons drawn for the maintenance of our fanſy fall out of our unwary hands. And is it otherwayes poſſible, that any faction in the world ſhould
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:121335:21"/>not have the capacity to think, that as they judge and condemn all the world beſides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, ſo alſo by all the reſt of the world are they themſelvs judged: and can they not ſee it as ridiculous in themſelvs to judg, as in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other whoſe judgment they contemn, and as eaſily ſuſpect themſelvs, as they do cenſoriouſly diſeſteem their neighbour, whom they cannot but acknowledg to be in other things their equalls, ther elders oftentimes in age, ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our haply in naturall parts, more eminent in birth and breeding, equally ſubjects of our common creatour, and haply in all civil reſpects their betters. Is not this prodigious? and what can it rationally be attributed unto, but ſome maligne ſubſtance inviſible, that makes a fool of mankind? Are not men blaſted? Are they not inchanted. I ſhould think nothing els can be ſaid for it: and therfore they run and fling, and turn up tail, and ſnuff the wind, and hoof-beat the earth, and bellow to battle, as if they were ſtung with gad flies. But let us uſe moderation, God dwells not in a whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind. If every one would but once begin to ſuſpect himſelf as in all prudence he may, the buſineſs were half ended, and a right under ſtanding very forwardly on.</p>

                  <p>For tell me, I pray you Sir that ſtruggle ſo much and ſo earneſtly for the propagation of your opinion; What good is it that I ſhould think as you do? Is it for your own intereſt, or for mine? If your own, I am not bound to ſerv your fanſy, or inſlave my underſtanding to your pleaſur; if for mine, I thank you for your good will, but refuſe your ſervice. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you may have a thought concerning God or natur, perhaps better than mine, (if I
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:121335:22"/>have any) or worth my hearing, if I have none; yet can you not rationally think either that you are bound in juſtice to communicate it unto me, or I to embrace it? There is nothing but charity to urge you, which is neither obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate nor ſeditious; nor doth any law of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice oblige me to accept of your favour if you offer it; ſith every one ſtands as free in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf either to refuſe or accept a good turn prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by another, as that other to preſent it. Will you urg and force me to be of your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which perhaps I look upon either as of no concernment at all to me or falſe? And who made me your vaſſail? So great a vaſſail as to command my thoughts; and thoſe too, which are verſed not about your ſelf or me, but our common creatour, and his works and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; which if they be rectified in you by any light to me unknown, enjoy your own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, I envy it not; leav me to my ſelf as I do you, and do not importunely againſt the very laws of right reaſon obtrude a courteſy upon him that likes it not, nor thinks it ſo. Had you any true charity for me, you would not diſturb my peace, which even in your own judgment is one of our greateſt goods, for an opinion of yours which you cannot but ſee to be in my judgment of ſo little valiew. Let it be what it will, a forced favour is an affront: force but a dog to eat or drink when he has not a liſt to it,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:121335:23"/>and ſee but how that very poor beaſt will take it. Are not you and I worms of the earth both of us, and equally ſubject unto that ſours of light which is above? Why then ſhould you go about to perſwade me to take my influence from your body, which is of no leſs opacity than mine own? You are inlightened, you ſay, and have received a truth which I want. Firſt you are aſſured no more than my ſelf that it is a truth; and although you may think you be, one mans word is in this thing I am ſure as good as anothers; and if you have received it, and it be ſuch, can you not be happy alone as well in this as other things, or permit your neighbour to walk as well naked of truth as clothes or other neceſſaries, which you will never thruſt upon any, although your ſelf never ſo much abound and he want: if I do want your truth, my want if it be any harm, it is mine own not yours. But let it be a truth received, is therfore the whole cours and order of the Univers changed? Why may not I have that light if any ſuch thing it be, from that generall ſuperiour caus whence you received it? it cannot be wrought in me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, why may it not by him without you as well in me as your ſelf? How are you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of a ſudden unto me a ſtar of influence, who was the other day a portion of the ſame earth and darkneſs with me?</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:121335:23"/>
                  <p>But now you begin to be angry, that I will not admit of the happines you bring me: and are you ſo indeed? then by your favour your propoſition was made to me not from charity but pride not unto my good but ſlavery: becaus I am really perhaps above you, ther muſt be a trick invented to bring me under in conceit; and to captivate his underſtanding who is in power and ability your betters: thus ſhall you get a dignity by the ſhadow of your fanſy, where you could not appear by any demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of reall and apparent worth. But now grown more wroth, you call me bruit beaſt, and dog and imp of darknes: and ſo you break forth out of the cloud you walked in, and the ſheepskin broken, the true face of a wolf is ſeen; it was pride not charity that ſpake in you; you offered to give to me, in hopes I ſhould thereupon fall down and worſhip; upon my refuſal you claw me with your curſes; a ſign that your propoſall was not for my good but your own, to work a glory not in me but over me, and to boaſt your ſelf in my conqueſt. If you had been born my Prince you could not have commanded my thoughts, do you think by commanding them to make your ſelf one? Content your ſelf. Puffing guſts of new fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies under what pretens ſoever they com (new reaſon, new light or new revelation in any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon) are for their very violence to be
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:121335:24"/>ſuſpected. When I hear any to cenſur all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and to diſparage all judgments but his own, I begin then to think worſe of his than all others; for true knowledg walks not with univerſall contempt. If the way be indeed of God, peace and meeknes will accompany it at leaſt in the firſt teacher. God reſides not in tempeſts, nor does even he himſelf force mans will. The very Goſpel and volum of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity was not thruſt upon us, but gently put into our hands upon our own good liking, by perſwaſion of miracles and words of peace.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe we are ſevered you and I as well in ſoul as body; nor is my ſoul any more than body any part of you; how comes it then, that being ſo carles of my body which you do ſee you are ſo zealous of my ſoul you ſee not? You are no more to anſwer for me herafter in another life, than you eat and drink for me in this; nor partake there more than here either of my weal or woe. But your charity urges you forſooth for my future good, and how coms it then ſo dead and ſenceles of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. There be many waies of help you might afford me in this life, in order to my welfar in it; if you heed me not in all theſe diſtreſſes which you ſee and I feel, what eſteem can I have of your pretended wellwiſhes in a ſtate ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary abroad, for charity if it be true begins at home.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:121335:24"/>
                  <p>I have reaſon to think that God is as good to me as he is to you, and will afford me as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny helps of light and reaſon as another: if not, he hath left me at leaſt in my own power to choos my guide, which ſhall be ſuch a one as I ſhall judg aforehand to be wiſer than my ſelf. All vaſſailage is againſt natur, and when any man enters upon it on his own accord, it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome hopes of a foredeemed greater good than without it he could have had; but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo thought without an imagined prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in the guide we fix upon. Now there is no captivity more eminent than that of the underſtanding, which therfore is of all others to be moſt ſpontaneous and rationall, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either temerity or force; but it is raſhnes in me and not reaſon, to truſt my ſelf to the conduct of a man I know to be as ignorant as my ſelf, and deſtitute of all autority over me in thoſe affaires, without either conviction of reaſon or motive of miracle; and for him to raiſe any mutiny againſt me, thereby to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to the obeyſance of his thoughts whom he hath no reaſons to perſwade, is a force too too bruitiſh and contrary to all lawes both of God and reaſon. I may indeed if I pleas ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to your direction: but can I do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allity and earneſt, unles beforehand I conceiv more of wiſdom to be reſident in you, than I find to be in my ſelf? Can any Pilgrim yield up

Becaus you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not maiſter my thoughts and make me a vaſſail to your conceits, which I am ſo far from judging rationall, that I cannot but think them both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and ſenceles, you will therfore take upon you to maiſter my eſtate and life: and perhaps only to effect this you pretend the other: what is this but robbery and murder commenced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a pretens of charity? There be ſom theeves in the world that will not aſſault a traveller, till they have offered him as a preparative to their convenience, the ſight of ſom curioſity to ſtand and demurr upon: I heard once of an honeſt traveller who in this manner gave thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty peeces of gold for a hare offered him in his journey by a ſeeming countrey man to buy for his ſupper, chooſing rather againſt his judgment to make ſuch a market than to dye for his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy; but is this a good and commendable violence? Shall we prais theſe actions or do like to them? God forbid.</p>
                  <p>You look upon me as an accurſed thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the beleef and light you walk by: And why

If I do it not, learn vertue of me, that ſo you may the ſooner perſwade me to com to you for knowledg. And how coms it to paſs you do ſo look upon me? Are you a Chriſtian? So am I. Have you meditated ſeriouſly upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Goſpel, and hopes of a future reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection? I have don ſo too: have you lived juſtly ſoberly and piouſly in this world, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting our bleſſed hopes in the comming of our Lord Jeſus in glory? I do the ſame; and if I may ſpeak on word <hi>ſecundum inſipientiam</hi> perhaps more, in mortification more frequent, more abounding in charity, more conſtant in the integrity of all my dealings, more chaſt and ſober, leſs intangled in this preſent world, or any affections therof, more affected to my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and redeemer, and I am perſwaded, that God doth inhabit and dwell within me. Why then do you trouble me? he was of another ſpirit who ſaid, <hi>Siquis aliter ſentit, Deus ipſi &amp; hoc revelabit:</hi> He that never judged amiſs in points of Religion had ſo much meeknes in him, as to conceit if any one in this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular thought otherwis than himſelf, that God either had or would reveal it him, and ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from cenſuring; wheras you condemn all men that think not as you do, who for aught I know think aright of nothing.</p>

                  <p>The very true beleef and right judgment of things, whence is it, or how come we by it? If it be mans own operation, you cannot tell but that I have it. If it be Gods work, you cannot blame me if I have it not; his gifts are free and diſpenſed as himſelf pleaſes: Am I in fault or do I deſerv to be vext and haraſſed by my neighbour, becaus the Kings majeſty hath not given me a chain of gold?

                  <p>St. Paul having ſeverely chid the people of Corinth in his firſt Letter he wrote to them for their many diſorders, and ſome ſuch like diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (though in a far inferiour degree) as ours in England be, and their great obſtinacy and feuds therupon, with variety of pious rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick upon every ſubject they ſo contentiouſly diſagreed in, inſinuated at laſt; that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they might pretend for thoſe their various Schiſmes, from the power and Spirit of God, (even as we here do) yet God was not indeed and really amongſt them at all; for God, ſaith
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:121335:26"/>he, is not the God of diſſention but of peace: and then he addes a great Oracle, which he left behinde him for after ages, to ſtop all diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous feuds that might ever ariſe in any people about the preheminence of doctrin in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, wherin each one may pretend to be chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt guide. <hi>An à vobis,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>verbum Dei pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſit, an in vos ſolos pervenit?</hi> Did the word of God proceed from you, or unto you only did it com? as if he ſhould have ſaid, you have not reaſon, you people of Corinth, to ſtand ſo much upon your opinions in matters of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or to conteſt ſo hotly about them to your mutuall diſparagements and breach of peace, ſith the Goſpel and word of God neither came forth from any of you, nor yet did it com only to you, that any of you ſhould therby (and otherwis it could not be) preſume to be teacher of the reſt in opinions and waies they cannot in their reaſon approve of, unles they ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your autority before it. Here then is preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed a moſt oraculous rule, both to know whence the right Chriſtian truth is to be deduced in any matter of doubt, and whoſe conduct is to be rejected, whatever light or knowledg any one may pretend by way of priviledg, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining over other men the preheminencie of a guide or leader. That man or thoſe people who can rightly challenge a power of leading other men in a way of religion muſt be ſuch and only
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:121335:27"/>ſuch, as either the word of God came from, or unto whom alone the word of God came. And it muſt needs in reaſon be ſo; for who ſhould teach us in any ſcience, or reſolv any doubts ariſing in it, but the maiſter who firſt ſhewed it (if any ſuch can be found) or which at firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed it: I ask then all theſe our religious duelliſts, both Anabaptiſt and Quaker, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian and Proteſtant: Did the word of God <hi>com from</hi> you, or came it <hi>unto you</hi> alone? and unto which of you did it firſt come, that we may adhere unto that party without diſpute. He <hi>from</hi> whom it came, muſt have the primary guidance over all; and he <hi>unto</hi> whom it firſt came, muſt carry a ſecondary preſidentſhip over all ſuch as be derived from him; but which of you is it that can pretend to either. That it came not alone to either our Puritan or Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant is evidently apparent, ſith by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the apoſtle it went forth unto all the ends of the earth: and indeed our own experience and knowledg of ſeverall Kingdomes that be Chriſtian would ſufficiently witnes that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any teſtimony at all: and that it came not forth <hi>from</hi> either of them is as manifeſt as the other, ſith the word and Goſpel of Chriſt was in the world many ages before any of thoſe waies were extant: and the Puritan with all their factions found that word here in England in the hands of the Proteſtant, and the Poteſtant it is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:121335:27"/>well enough known wreſted it from the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick, who had lived in it a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years before any Proteſtant was known or heard of in the Land<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> and the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick received it from his Papal Paſtour or Biſhop, the Brittain from Pope Eleutherius, the Saxon from Pope Gregory the Great as all hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories witneſs. Let us take heed then, we incurr not the cenſur of mad men, for pretending with ſo many furious quarrells both by tongue and pen and ſword a precedency in religion one over another, where according to this great oracle of S. Paul it is manifeſt that none of us can have any; nay by this rule we cannot have ſo much as truth amongſt us, any further then we are conformable unto him <hi>from</hi> whom the word of God came, or to them <hi>unto</hi> whom it firſt came: and if we make a ſtrict examin, we ſhall find that they <hi>unto whom</hi> the Goſpel in this nation firſt came, were not either Proteſtants, Presbyterians, or Independents; and he <hi>from whom</hi> it came was one whom all theſe do hate. Where then is truth, and which of theſe duel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts hath the precedency in it? I mention not the the Papiſt or Roman Catholick amongſt the reſt; both becaus he raiſes not troubles but is on the ſuffering ſide, oppugned by all opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters of what ever kind they be, and defamed and vexed by them all, who notwithſtanding upon the ſame account of religion defame and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:121335:28"/>vex one another, unto the daily diſquiet and overthrow of our Kingdom: as alſo becaus I beleeve he would ſoon anſwer the doubt, and by the teſt of this great oracle carry away the precedency from us all, and we all found to have no more truth in us than we have confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity unto Roman-catholicks. Wherefore gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen I ſhall never ingage my ſelf in any of your feudes, (and I would to God none els would do it) till you anſwer me to this my que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, which I make to you all in generall, and to each party in particular. <hi>An à vobis verbum Dei proceſſit, an ad vos ſolos pervenit,</hi> did the Goſpell firſt com from you, or only to you: If either, tell me which and on what ſide it is, and I ſhall be on that; if neither, I can be of no ſide, to follow it as my guide: for though each party may haply have in it ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of truth amongſt other fals inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (and all truths are not utterly aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the ſodain) yet can no ſuch party hold forth any doctrin I may ſafely build upon. That perſon, or that See, or that congregation from whom the goſpel came, or thoſe people at leaſt unto whom it firſt came legally delivered and not extorted and totally accepted without diminiſhment, commenſuratively unto his mind who ſent it, theſe are the onely perſons unto whom of divine right precedency ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, as all that will be of Chriſts myſtical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:121335:28"/>not onely may ſafely, but muſt univerſally follow them. But where this body of men may be, the Pope and Papiſts from whom and unto whom alone the goſpel firſt came, being by us concluded under errour, is ſo obſcure that I for my part having loſt them cannot find out whom I may ſafely adhere unto in the opinions and practiſes of religion: ſith none of us in <hi>England</hi> beſides them can according to this great oracle of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> pretend any right to guide his neighbour in thoſe wayes. Wherfor it were good wiſdom in my judgment to ſheath both our ſwords and pens, and be at peace, till we can find out a party among us that can make good this canonical title of prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence; for ſhe that can do it is the onely pure and mother Church, whom all muſt hear and obey unto: and all other factions that be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformable unto that holy Church from whom or unto whom firſt the goſpel came, are little better perhaps then ſtark naught.</p>
                  <p>I cannot ſee then as yet why we ſhould all of us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Presbyterian, Proteſtant, and Independent, inveigh ſo furiouſly either one againſt another within our ſelves, or all of us againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt: or why upon this account any one ſhould be puft up againſt his neighbour, or hate and proſecute him as an execrable thing; but that we ſhould rather ſtudy mutual comiſeration, charity and peace.</p>

                  <p>In truth opinions and controverſies once rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed were never yet allaied by reaſon, nor ever can be: for the firſt founder and forger of the novelty being moved thereunto by paſſion and intereſt (as in time it proves evident to the world) put on a reſolv never to yield, whether he held forth a natural or ſupernatural light as a weapon of his warfar; and therefor he will onely be tried by his own weapon, and that too ſhall ſignify nothing but in his own hand: which is a certain way of victory at leaſt in the eyes of the vulgar whom he ſeeks to inveigle, and conſequently both of intereſt and glory to himſelf.

Let truth and wiſdom flow like ſtreams from the lips of his opponent, let all ſort of rhetorick conſpire to his ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; if he do not laugh at it as empty ſounds and not the true word, as fleſh and not ſpirit, as man and not the Lord, as darknes and not light, as folly and not reaſon, as humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and no divine tradition, let me loſe belief for ever. And what end can there be made of ſuch new ſtarted doubts? or where lies the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or reaſon of their indeterminables, but only in the pride and obſtinacy of the firſt prophet and his diſciples, who indeed are not ſuch if they be not ſelf-willed and ſelf-conceited like himſelf.</p>
                  <p>And this may be the reaſon of that ſage ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice the Apoſtle gives to Titus; <hi>Haereticum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem poſt unam &amp; alteram correptionem devita,</hi> &amp;c. An heretical man check him once or twice and then avoid him: for he is utterly ſubverted and condemned in his own judgment.

                  <p>If there were any true reſpect in the world or eſteem of one another; if every man had but that value of his neigbour which he hath of himſelf, whereas he hath oftentimes reaſon to have more) then would all theſe opinion-feuds either not kindle at all, or be ſoon extinguiſhed. For although it could hardly be prevented con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering humane conſtitution, but that odde thoughts and various whimſies would riſe in the minds of men that are left to themſelvs; yet ſo long as they remained inward without iſſuing forth to life, or as a ſtill-born child never to walk abroad, all would be well enough betwixt neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and charity inviolate amongſt them. It were a moſt happy thing, if the fanatick wombs, and brains of mortals would thus miſcarry in the child-birth, and their conceit com forth ſtill-born: and ſo indeed it would, did not ſelf-opinion midwife it into the world and preſerv its life.</p>
                  <p>But as ſoon as the <hi>mind</hi> has once conceived
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:121335:31"/>of her <hi>incubus,</hi> ſhe ſwells preſently with pride, that every vein ſtretches, and labours hugely to bring forth; the featous babe when it is once out, does ſo mightily pleas the dam, that it is carried from city to city to be ſhown; and ſee the wonder within a ſmall ſpace we have thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of that opinion all ready preſt to undergo a martyrdom for the imp; ſo prone is mankind to deluſion. But in the true hous and manſion of Jeſus, who is the right and onely ſplendour of divine glory all this baſtardly brood is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated, for the moſt part in the conception by the ſpirit of him who reſides there, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the birth by the care of government in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and obſerved in that place: and if the harlot do by her ſubtilty bring forth and expoſe her brat to view ſhe flies for it, and the chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering moon-calf as ſoon as they can catch it is ſtifled.</p>
                  <p>Ith interim there is nothing brought forth ſo deformed, but it is hugged and careſſed as the faireſt of creatures; ſuch ſelf conceit accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies all theſe natural conceptions: go about to convince it to be the ſeed of ſatan, and dirt will be thrown in your face; this is the ſucceſs and event of all diſputes in religion: no man will ever be confuted, or if really he be, he will not acknowledge it, not deſert his caus; for to ſeem to be convinced, is to ſuffocate his intereſt and glory with his own hands.</p>

                  <p>When opinions therefor once riſe, there is ſome reaſon indeed in Power, but no power at all in Reaſon, either to aſſwage or ſtifle them: and if they do multiply, as they are very nimble and volatile, apt to fly and encreas like fire in dry ſtubble before a ſtrong wind, then power it ſelf is humbled before them as unreaſonable and ſenceles, even as before all reaſon was eſteemed impotent and weak. If princes would ſeriouſly lay theſe things to heart, much of evil might be prevented in a kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Let any man think within himſelf what he pleaſes; thoughts are free and do harm to none, but haply to the ſpirit of himſelf: but if once having invented a conceit he go about to compel his neighbours to think as he does, otherwiſe to bring upon them vexation and ruine; if he be reſtles till one of theſe be don, and begin to make ſigns thereof, as ſymptoms of an approaching earthquake, then let all men take heed and he eſpecially that ſits above the reſt, whoſe care it is to look to the ſafety of us all, and all our welfare too is involved in the peace and ſafety of himſelf.</p>
                  <p>I have often wondered in my ſelf, that ſince all mens opinions are their own ſelfcreated pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſes wherein they ſolace and pleas themſelvs, why they ſhould not be content to enjoy their pleaſures alone, but are reſtles till they have brought all others in to their garden of delight
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:121335:32"/>and made them taſte of their fruit. It is not uſually ſo in other delightful pleaſures of this world, whereof all men endeavour to make a monopoly to themſelvs, if they be more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial delights. And yet after ſom ſerious thoughts we may diſcern a reaſon for it upon ſight of the great pride which their own words and geſtures bewray in them. They would be as gods unto men, for whom they create out of nothing ſo pretty a fanſy of pleaſure: Another would ſay, they rather appear like the ſerpent in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, diſcovering more as they pretend of Gods ſecrets than plain old Adam and Eve ever dreamed of.</p>
                  <p>Let it be what it will, believe me in this the hieroglyphick is clear; After God hath once ſetled a Church wherein is the tree of life, if any one neglecting the things which are ordained for his uſe and benefit begin to diſcover new diſturbing ſecrets not before heard of in the place, let every one then beware; <hi>latet anguis in herba.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt is, the great ignorance our ſtate and condition is involved, concerning either God in himſelf, or his works or providence. This is the firſt. And if any anticipate and ſay, that the ſcripture reveals enough unto us; I anſwer it is true, if men would content themſelvs to uſe it to that purpoſe it was written, for to guid our feet in the practiſe of ſolid goodneſs ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety and juſtice upon a hopes of future bliſs promiſed to all ſuch as ſhall be ſound ſo doing in him that revealed it: for this is both the compendium and end of that holy writ, and it is enough. But if not thinking of this, we uſe it, as now generally we do, to rais and ſtrengthen us in new opinions, for which it was never intended (tho for aught I can ſee it is the greateſt if not the ſole uſe we make of it) then it rather makes our maze greater then leſſens it, and through our abuſe of it puts us beſides thoſe truths and wayes, which otherwiſe we ſhould very patiently and conſtantly purſue. Whence are all theſe varieties of opinions now in England, and the obſtinacy each one hath in his own, but by the confident abuſe of that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred book, out of which we throw texts as one another, as the old — Tectour Oliver uſed in his ſports to caſt carpets and cuſhions about the heads of his play mates, and in his feaſts apple tarts and cuſtards, which were never made for that purpoſe tho he was pleaſed ſo to abuſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:121335:33"/>them for his paſtim. Experience hath now taught us clear enough, that the ſcriptur is a dangerous edged tool to put into the hands of the rude and boiſterous vulgar. A compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous narration of the ſtory and morallity of it, ſo ordered unto ſolid practis, that it were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be uſed for nothing elſe (either for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes or jeſting conceits) kept our Engliſh Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian nation for a thouſand years together, ſo long as it was catholick, in all unity and peace, and rendered them fruitful in all good works; whereas the whole and very text now in this laſt age put into vulgar hands, together with a fore apprehenſion and belief of the unmerito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſnes and unprofitablenes of good works in order to eternal life, unto which forſooth faith onely ſuffices (which is contrary to the very genius and end and purpoſe of Gods word and them that wrote it) hath filled the land with ſo much wretchleſnes and diviſions. And who ſhall interpret the ſcripture to us, to the end it may guide our thoughts without errour? It ſelf? ſo ſom ſay; but then, if we may gueſs at the natur of it by the fruits of the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation we have from it, what a Chaos of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion would it be thought to be; for ſuch be the contradictory interpretations that are all ſaid to come from it: Shall the Church inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it? no this is Popiſh: and what Church? thoſe in whoſe hands we found it, or from

Muſt neither interpret, but onely the ſpirit and divine light within our ſelves; this may be it muſt teach us to know all things; but what is the thing ſhall teach us to know it? how ſhall we be aſſured that it is a ſpirit or light divine; if we miſtake here our pretended light my prove an <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> and no leſs fooliſh the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination by it. If we do not know even our own ſoul and ſpirit within us, what it is, how it informs our bodie, how it works in it all thoſe ſeveral operations of thoughts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal alterations, or whence it comes, or how it is annexed to us while it ſtayes, why it departs, or whither it goes (as it is certain we do not) how can we judg aſſuredly whence ſuch or ſuch a thought ariſes in it, from God above or ſenſual cauſes, tho it never ſo much pretend a divine miſſion and be transfigured into a ſhape angelical, or that any ſpirit or light within us is truly divine and not phantaſtical. Do not the corporeal ſpirits inflamed by often beating upon an object naturally hammer forth ſuch odde phantoſms in great abundance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either order or meaſure, inveſted all of them in ſuch ſhapes as the artificer forged himſelf,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:121335:34"/>without any other exteriour aid but objective repreſentations, which ofentimes ſo vigorouſly repreſent themſelves that from the objects of thought they ſtand at length in place of the ſubject thinking. If any one will not beleev me, let him but take the pains to make a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into Bedlam here in London, Paris, and other Cities, and convers but a while with the mad men there, and then he will ſoon finde it true? There he ſhall meet with counteſſes, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, biſhops, kings, nor real as themſelvs ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, but fantaſtick and whimſical ones; nay ſome one there will pretend to be Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, another the Holy Ghoſt, a third God the Father of all things; and what not? and the fanſy too is ſo ſtrong and prevalent, that the whip may chance at length to beat it out, but all the reaſoning in the world ſhall not do it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond conſideration to promote mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and conſequently to make way for a right underſtanding is the ſad precipices men have run themſelvs and others by their headi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and temerarious obſtinacy in their opinions and conceits, even to the utter ruine and depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation of flouriſhing kingdoms, as ancient hiſtories will copiouſly witneſs. And if any ſay, <hi>Alas what do you tell us of thoſe men, they were a ſelf-deluded people;</hi> Does not the world ſay ſo of you? <hi>Oh but we know the contrary.</hi> Juſt ſo ſaid they. <hi>O but we cannot be deceived, the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:121335:34"/>truth, the word, the Lord himſelf cannot lye, heaven and earth may fail theſe cannot.</hi> This was even their very ſong. <hi>O then if it be ſo, they were in the right too!</hi> Then you are not, for they were in many things of a contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to you all of them, and ſom in all things. <hi>Well well God knows his elect.</hi> 'Tis true, but you know them not. <hi>No not I, why ſhould I not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I be reprobate?</hi> You may be ſo, walk then in fear. <hi>He that hath the light muſt he not needs ſee it.</hi> If he have it near him he may, ſo that he be not hood-winked or blinded with a prejudice: and he may think too he ſees it, when he has it not; I have often waked at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and thought my whole chamber en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, but by and by perceived it was only the glimpſes of ſome natural luminous ſpirits not in the chamber, but under my own eye-lids which was a vaniſhing and falſe light; and not at all in the place I took it to be. <hi>You may as well ſay as much of the apoſtles and prophets them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> I may ſo, and would do it without any fear at all, if I had no other motives of reſpect to their words than I have to yours. <hi>Com, com if the truth be hid, it is hid to them that be loſt.</hi> Be it ſo, yet ſtill the queſtion will be, whether I be loſt or you, whether you or all mankind beſide.</p>
                  <p>The third conſideration is, the genuin and connaturall excellency of a good Chriſtian
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:121335:35"/>man (whether we follow reaſon or autority in deciphering it) which conſiſts not in finding new wayes to the reformation of other mens thoughts, but putting in practiſe the old re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived well known dictates of ſobriety juſtice and piety in our ſelvs, with ſubmiſſion unto the direction of ſuch as delivered them unto us from that one Lord we all worſhip. <hi>Oh but men have ſwarved from thoſe wayes.</hi> Let them; they ſhall bear their own burden, do not you ſwarv and it ſhall be well with you: themſelvs and ſuch as were ſet over them (as I know you are not) ſhall render an account for thoſe loſt ſheep, whiles you are ſafe and being innocent have no account to give either for your ſelvs or others. <hi>O but the zeal of the Lords hous doth eat us up.</hi> Good, let not that zeal of yours eat the Lords hous up, and all is well. <hi>Away away we cannot abide biſhops and prieſts and copes and ſurplices, they are very beams in our wayes.</hi> It is is a ſign of a weak and ill-affected eye, not to be able to look upon any thing. You ſhall not be burdened with the wearing either of the veſtments or titles; and the meer ſeeing ſhould not be methinks ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom. And yet late experience hath made it evident (whatſoever tendernes you may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) that you are able to bear upon your ſelvs even that you pretend you cannot look upon at a diſtance: which is an odde kind of riddle.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:121335:35"/>The office of a prieſt and biſhop (which you ſay is onely to preach) together with his ſtate and means; this you have not onely born very tamely theſe years of our confuſion but earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thruſt your ſelvs into it. And is it not a ſtrange tendernes to ſweat under a burden which another man bears, and not to be troubled at all when we bear it our ſelvs, nay to thruſt our ſelves into it? their copes diſlike you in the Church, but in your own houſes they make a goodly fine ſhow, and their very ſurplices pleas you well when they are next to your own skin. What it was that the fox fell out with the lovely grapes, it appeared afterward when they were ſeen griped ſo greedily within his teeth; the only caus of his diſlike and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment invectivs againſt them was (and a ſhrewd one it was) that himſelf could not come at them. <hi>Nay, nay 'tis the Popery, 'tis that we diſlike.</hi> If the fox could have ſpoke, he would have called thoſe grapes popiſh too; for now adayes all that ſtands in our way, and all that we would undermine, and cannot immediately reach, we cry out upon as popery; which is a ſound ſo inflames the vulgar ears, that they all flock together at that alarm againſt father and mother, Prince and neighbour, Church and ſtate without any further conſideration, to the aſſiſtance of that cunning wag who by that ſo taking a ſtratagem raiſed a publick help for the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:121335:36"/>working of his own deſign. The Popery you ſay you diſlike: This you may do, without diſturbing either your own or other mens peace: there be a thouſand thinks I diſlike every day, as I walk along through London ſtreets, which no prudence dictates me to check or ſeek to rectifie. It is not the cuſtom of a traveller (and we are all pilgrims upon earth) to cut up buſhes or lop hedges that hang in their eyes as they paſs; but peaceably to go beſide them, without further nois, or diſquiet; and if any ſhould do otherwiſe, he would be looked upon as a mad man, and haply run himſelf into jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy: but what if popery prove at length not to be any evil thing at all, but good and pious, how ever repreſented to us all this while as odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous under the bug bear of that name. I know you will ſtartle at this word; but you would not do ſo, had you my experience. Chriſt and his Chriſtianity was long ago by ſuch invectivs and ignominious appellations, made as odious in the world as now it can poſſibly be under the name of popery: inſomuch that of the three, Epicureans, Chriſtians and Atheiſts (which were generally put together, as a triplicity of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination) the profeſſours of Chriſtianity was ever put in the middle as the moſt impious of all the three, not only in their lives but in their opinions and beleef; and as ſuch they were dealt with throughout all the Roman empire
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:121335:36"/>for three hundred years together whiles that empire was pagan, contemned, pillaged, tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as people of the moſt wicked profeſſion the earth ever bore: and all Europ wherein there were even then as many great wiſe heads, and as morally honeſt perſons as ever there were in the pagan world beleeved it; ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hath a popular vogue once raiſed to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of any, eſpecially if autority do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly conſpire to their ruin. It is not my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at this time either to oppugne popery or defend it; for in oppugning it I may chance indeed to pleas ſom, in defending it I am ſure to pleas no body; for the Catholicks although they know in general that by the name of <hi>papiſt</hi> and <hi>popery</hi> their perſons and profeſſions are aimed at, yet what their adverſary would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs by popery when he objects it to them, there is not one catholick in England under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands. If it be an expreſſion of their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, they have no rule for that but the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; if of the ſuperſtitions, idolatries, murders, treaſons, adulteries, lyes, pride, gluttonies, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally put upon them under that name, they know no ſuch religion. And if popery ſhould be proved in any part not good, this of epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy and their decent ornaments may be no part of it that is naught: nay whether it be any part of popery at all, not we (who do not know what popery is) but they who profeſs it,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:121335:37"/>or at leaſt profeſs a religion that is loaded with this name muſt judg: and theſe do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg our Proteſtant Biſhops or any of their rites (if we mean by popery the religion they profeſs) to be any popery at all. <hi>Oh but if it be not popery, 'tis at leaſt foppery, and we will have it taken away.</hi> Be it what it will, have you peace within your ſelf; if it be any inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man, it will moulder away as mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions do; if it be either inſtituted or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of God, who can reſiſt him? Be firſt aſſured what it is before you attempt to remove it; and when you are reſolved, chooſe to do it, no by tumult but by wayes of peace. This prudent and honeſt method of proceeding in ſuch caſes as theſe is well ſet down by a Scribe or Juſtice of Peace amongſt the Epheſians up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion of the like uproar. <hi>There was made a loud cry of all the people</hi> ſaith the ſacred text in the Acts of the Apoſtles, <hi>as it were for two hours together crying out, great is Diana of the Epheſians</hi> (and every mans opinion is his Diana) <hi>and when the clerk of the court, had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed the uproar, he ſaid, Men of Epheſus, what man is there amongſt us, that is ignorant that the City of the Epheſians is a worſhipper of great Diana and the off-ſpring of Jove; whereas therefor theſe things cannot be gain-ſaid, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooves you to be quiet and to do nothing raſhly. Ye have brought hither men neither ſacriligious
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:121335:37"/>nor blaſphemers of your gods. But if Demetrius and the artificers with him have aught againſt any one, the courts are open and proconſuls ready, let them accuſe one another there: if ye would any thing further, in a lawful aſſembly it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided; for we are in danger to be called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion for this dayes ſedition, whereas there is no one man in ſo great a tumult, of whom we can give an account as authour of this concours.</hi> Thus ſpake that wiſe pagan, and the counſel is very good in all ſuch caſes, whereof this of ours is one. <hi>Oh but theſe biſhops do captivate mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and take away our Chriſtian liberty, they would force us to a belief and liking of their wayes.</hi> Say you ſo? then you may ſhake hands, for you would force them and others to a liking of yours. <hi>But we neither can nor will approve of them.</hi> They neither can nor will aſſent to you. <hi>They have no reaſon but their own pride.</hi> The alledg pride to be all your reaſon. <hi>The ſpirit and God that is in us urges us to hate all the works of the devil.</hi> So ſay they, <hi>There is no communion with light and darknes, God and Belial:</hi> They ſay ſo too; you will be friends anon. <hi>Bleſſed is he that hates iniquity from his heart.</hi> This is the very ſubject of their ſermons; you are now becom one of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <hi>We their diſciples? no, we bow not our head to any horned beaſt.</hi> Very good, they like your reſolution, and will not therfor bow their heads to you.</p>

                  <head>§ <hi>6.</hi> Obſcurity of God.</head>
                  <p>OF the three abovenamed conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which being well imprinted in our hearts I ſhould deem ſufficient to put all our animoſities to ſilence, the two laſt be rather moral then acroamatick to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, and therefore to be caſt with their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows into the laſt paragraff of the book. The firſt which ſpeaks the great ignorance our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition is involved, both concerning God and his works and providence, requires a little more explicit diſcours; and becaus it is a ſpeculation very beneficial not only to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos I now aim at, but abſolutely in it ſelf, and for ſeveral uſes of mans life, it ſhall take up the three or four following paragraffs. And if all theſe things (and religion can be about nothing els but them) both God nature and providence do prove ſo obſcure, as I find them to be, and I think will to all that ponder the matter well, evidently appear; what is then the knowledg
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:121335:38"/>we boaſt of, and of which we are ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as to preſcribe laws every one of us to the whole land, and to bring all into confuſion about it.</p>
                  <p>He that ſhall think upon God alone, apart from heaven and earth and every what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever created ſubſtance viſible or inviſible, as in the center of his own all-ſufficient eternity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either earth or heaven was made, muſt needs be ſwallowed up, and darkened round about, as if he ſtood in the center of a world of waters, and for want of a proper idea to fix on melt away in reverence of that all venerable and and ſacred being, which is an unmeaſurable and boundleſs ocean of wiſdom power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in himſelf: And altho he may have much improved himſelf by the frequent ſtudy and meditation of the ſubtil books Chriſtendom hath brought forth; yet ſhall he find himſelf ſo infinite ſhort of any ſatisfying knowledg con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, that he muſt conclude himſelf to remain ſtill in the wondring ſide, and to know nothing. Whenſoever I think of that firſt <hi>Eſſe</hi> we call God, both S Thomas and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Scotus and all writings or conceits of men fail and fall ſhort, and help me little or nothing, no nor any ſcripture whatſoever: they ſeem all to ſpeak ſomething about God, nothing of him, indeed they cannot. In this our earth and exile we have no words to expreſs him, no
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:121335:39"/>notion to conceiv him as he is in himſelf, no idea to repreſent him; which perhaps is the reaſon moved ſubtil <hi>Scotus</hi> to teach, that our divinity is not ſpeculative but practical, leſt it ſhould be a ſcience that ſignifies nothing; for love of that divine object makes up all.</p>
                  <p>Our Lord is verily a <hi>hidden</hi> God, ſaith one no leſs piouſly than truly; hidden in himſelf and eſſence, hidden in his works, hidden in his providence, hidden in his own life and being, and hidden too in all his emanations and the egreſſions of eternity. Nor can any created being in the higheſt pitch of all poſſible excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency naturally approach that unacceſſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in his ſtate of pilgrimage and mutability. The diſcovery of himſelf unto them is their bliſs; it is their condition ſupernatural and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of glory.</p>
                  <p>What then can poor man a worm and duſt, in this his ſtate of ſin corruption and darknes preſume to know of <hi>Him,</hi> whom no inviſible creatur or the higheſt angel can pry into even in the higheſt excellency of his ſpiritual condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, out of his ſtate of immutability and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. No man can ſee God and live, and no angel can ſee God and dye: for the viſion is inconſiſtent either with our mortality or their ſtate of probation; we muſt be elevated above our mortal life, they exalted from their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mutability by that viſion once imparted.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:121335:39"/>God is an abyſſe of beatitude reſerved onely for the infinity of bliſs in the ſtate of eternity, where new raviſhing wonders and extaſies and joyes ſhall ſpring up from him without end, to the daily freſh beatifying of all thoſe ſpirits that ſhall be thought worthy of that glorious never failing day.</p>
                  <p>Nor is there any way left for man to reach this infinite abyſſe but by affection. The will of man is far longer winged than his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and love will find acceſs where knowledg cannot approach. For tho it be true that an unknown thing cannot be loved, yet may a man love more of a thing than he knows, and faſten his affection upon that thing in particular; whereof he hath but a general and confuſed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion: Thus I may love a mans perſon whom I never ſaw and conſequently know not, by a report of his goodneſs or ſight of his hand writing, which love will embrace the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon himſelf tho it be guided by no more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg then that of his words or geſture or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten conceptions: ſo God repreſented unto us under the general and metaphyſical notions of an infinite ſubſtantial ocean of goodneſs wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and power, from whom do all things flow, by whom they ſubſiſt, and in whom fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally they end, the firſt caus eternal immenſe omnipotent, the beſt and greateſt, creatour and conſerver of all that is or can be, ſubſtantial
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:121335:40"/>wiſdom and ſanctity, immutable, hater of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and lover of good, the beginning and end of things, eſſential truth and light and life, the very being of all beings, the ſolace of all ſpirits, and ſole beatifying bliſs and the like; tho this and much more ſaid of him as notions adjacent and metaphyſical properties of that eternal and ineffable eſſence ſuffice us for our knowledg of him in this world, yet is all the while that great eſſence from whence thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties flow unexpreſt and utterly hid, and God ſtill in his particular and ſpecifick entity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known God to us: and yet notwithſtanding God or that unknown eſſence is ſupereminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtimated adored and loved even in his very individual being by that ſpirit who will think of him and love him as he ought, even in this very ſtate of our exile, corruption and darknes. So far extended ſo ingenious and quick is love, that a very ſmall ſparkling of knowledg if it do but ſhow her afar off onely the outward fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſpiece and battlements where the beloved dwells, will enough ſuffice her for a guide to throw her ſelf into him boſom.</p>
                  <p>This great God and immens ſpring of life and being, if he be compared to the univers and whole creation conſiſting both of the millions of inviſible ſpirits and the great machin of this viſible world, he will be found as the only ſubſtance, and all things beſides him a thinne
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:121335:40"/>ſhadow; he ſolid entity, and the great univers in compariſon of him but a meer ſhow, far more differing than the body of a hous or tree, and the ſhadow thereof in the Sun: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for high contemplativs have called the world a vanity, a lye, a ſhadow, a non entity; and ſo indeed it is, compared with God wherein all being is ſubſiſtent in its ſubſtantial primogenial perfection: It muſt needs be ſo; whereby we may ſee, how deeply the ſenſual and carnal men of this world are deceived in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; whilſt they look upon this world and the things of this world, eſpecially that part of it they uſe for their pleaſur and delight, as things of true real and ſolid ſubſtance, but God the authour of all as an aiery flying fanſy, taking the ſubſtance for the ſhadow and the ſhadow for the ſubſtance: ſo groſly do we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude our ſelves in our conceits of God, and for his good deeds towards us diſhonour him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital. But the inveiglement of pleaſures brings us below our manhood and makes us think like beaſts.</p>
                  <p>The obſcurity of this moſt high God and his unacceſſible light (not to uſe any further argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than what is vulgar and before our eyes) will be made more than manifeſt, if we do but caſt our eyes upon the ſons of men round about this globe of earth our ſelves inhabit, and their various both inqueſts after him and conceptions
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:121335:41"/>of him. If men could do this one thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, all further pains of implanting in us true humility inſtead of pride, amazement in place of arrogance, fear in the room of preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſelf denial in exchange of that prodigious ſelf-confidence that abounds and rules in us might ſoon ceas. Who is he that dare preſume in any way of his own invention when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders (as very true it is) all mankind ſo many ſeveral wayes in all ages groping after a deity like ſo many blind men in a vaſt plane, by the help not of eyes (for who can diſcover or ſee him) but of that pittiful reed of weak imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And are not all theſe equally his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? do they not equally ſhow their love in ſeeking after him? have they not at their birth equal right to his favour, which before they were born they could no wayes demerit. And how then can infinite goodnes ſo neglect, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdom ſo far unheed, infinite power ſo deſert this poor wretched worm, that very fain would love him, would be very glad to find him, would think it a happines to ſerv him, and for this end ſeeks after him ſo inceſſantly, ſo variouſly, and by reaſon that he is a <hi>hidden</hi> God ſo fruitleſly as he does. In this perplexity remains mankind, till there appear a prophet or teacher to each nation who may direct and lead them. But when this happens, how much is poor man the nearer? There be haply as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:121335:41"/>ſeveral prophets as there be nations upon earth (for though two or three nations may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low one, yet ſome one nation hath two or three) and all theſe equally pretend to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, tho their laws and rules and religious rites be not only divers but oftimes oppoſite. What can we think when we contemplate this? where is truth, and how ſhall we have it (ſith we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find it out our ſelves) if not from the hands of ſuch as pretend to come from God? And yet they cannot all be true: which then is fals, and who is true? is there any way in nature to know it? for all eſtabliſh their own way and honour by all inventions poſſible within their reach, ſomtimes by miracles (which their own diſciples believ tho others deride them) often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by viſions and prophecies, generally by a ſhow of ſanctity, with a concours of threats and promiſes both preſent and future to the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latours and obſervers of their law. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for if any be true, as it is but a ſurmiſe to think it, ſo is it a meer chance to hit it; which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally done by birth, or caſual circumſtance of perſwaſion. Beſides a religion once eſtabliſhed be it true or fals (when it is once received it is then taken for true) in the ſpace of ſome ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages is reformed anew by other teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or interpreters, who in time lead men out of the former way into their own; ſomtimes ſlowly, gradually and inſenſibly, that they are
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:121335:42"/>brought into another religion before they be aware; ſometimes by open hoſtility to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which whether by covin or violence yields at laſt to the ingres of a new one.</p>
                  <p>This is the right caſe and buſineſs concerning religion in the world: people ſtill being vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently bent upon that they faſten upon, tho haply it be quite oppoſite to the former, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in both themſelvs and forefathers lived. Such is the miſerable inſtability of mankind; which is a ſign, that God and his truth, (how confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſoever men may be) is ever hidden and in-evident; for men do not uſe to depart from evidence: let Philoſophers diſpute never ſo ſubtilly to prove ſnow is black, they will get no followers; a contrary evidence detains even them that cannot tell how to anſwer their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments from a ſubmiſſion unreaſonable. Nor is there all this while any one ſect upon earth but condemns all other wayes beſides his own which he no leſs admires than he diſeſteems them; yea ſeparating from a former religion to another either in all things oppoſite or a part onely, men are apt to inveigh as bitterly againſt that now, as then they did againſt this, and with equal confidence of truth in both places. Where then is truth, and who ſees it? Is not God indeed hidden? does he appear at all to any; for although all ſay they ſee him and his truth with their eyes, it is evident enough by
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:121335:42"/>the mutations both perſonal and national that be made in the world, there is no ſuch matter (from God and from truth no man does wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly depart) as alſo by the oppoſite profeſſions of it with ſuch equal confidence, that it is not in the power of any man to ſay of himſelf aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly where it is. Archimed had an opinion that he could move the whole earth, had he but a place out of the earth to ſet his foot on; and ſo muſt he who ſhall judg of this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie ſtand in ſome place a part, where he may overſee all, not intereſted in any, in a word he muſt be out of the earth? nor is the atheiſt a fit judg, although he may bear himſelf for one; for as none can judg of men but he that owns ſuch a thing as humanity, ſo neither can he give any plauſible judgment of religions who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges none: nor yet is it an eaſy thing to pluck up the general connatural ſeeds of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on implanted in mans ſpirit, and ſprouting forth rather into the profeſſion of a fals religion than none.</p>
                  <p>Who dare then preſume of his knowledg, and what motives has he in himſelf to do ſo which another wants: Be it ſcriptures, prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, viſions, light, or inward aſſurance; boaſt of what you pleas, all the earth will do the like, and with the ſelf-ſame confidence. For let Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſphers ſpeak what they pleas of the certainty of object which ſom men have over and above
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:121335:43"/>the certainty of ſubject, I am not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv how an objectiv certainty can ſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out evidence, or how it may conſiſt with that mutability I ſee to be in the world; for men do depart as well from a good religion (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they would have to be certainty of object) as from a bad one wherein they allow only a certainty of ſubject, which is nothing but a perſonal ſelf-willed reſolution in their wayes.</p>
                  <p>Since men therefor do thus abound all of them in their own ſens, haply without ſence (if a thouſand voices may be of force againſt one ſingle one) how does it behoove us if we would be truly wiſe to walk all our dayes not in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes and diſquietneſs without end, but in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and fear. But ſom will ſay, all this is nothing to us, ſince Chriſt our Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us both God himſelf and all neceſſary truths concerning him, of all which we may be confident. But ſtay a while and ponder what I have already ſpoken; do not all nations ſay as much for themſelvs. <hi>What then! ſhould we doubt of our faith in Chriſt?</hi> no in no wiſe. But I muſt ſpeak a bold word: theſe very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions of ours about that faith in its branches ſo hot, ſo various, ſo extravagant, are apt to inferre a ſuſpicion of it in its very root: are not hundreds in our own countrey become atheiſts already upon that very motiv? and theſe men ſuppoſing ſubſtantial change once made in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:121335:43"/>and deliberately admitted are rather to be commended for their wit than blamed: for they do but that ſodainly which all the land will will come to by degrees. If the Papiſt or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man catholick who firſt brought the news of Chriſt and his Chriſtianity into the land, as all men muſt needs know that have either heard or read of Chriſtianities ingreſs into England or other countreys and kingdoms (for we do no ſooner hear news of Chriſtianity than Popery, and his crucifixes, monaſteries, reliques, ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and the like) I ſay if the Papiſt be now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com ſo odious as we ſee he is, and if the faith he brought and maintained a thouſand years together, be now rent all aſunder by ſects and factions which bandy all to the ruin of that mother religion; if all her practical truths wherein chiefeſt piety conſiſts be already abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed as erroneous; does not this juſtify the pagan whom this catholick Chriſtian diſplaced to make way for his own law: And muſt not this be a certain way and means to introduce atheiſm, which naturally follows that faith once removed even as a carkas ſucceeds a living body once deceaſed? for one truth denied is a fair way to queſtion another, which came by the ſame hand, and this a third, till the very autority of the firſt revealer be at ſtake, which can no more defend himſelf than he can his law; for the ſame axe and inſtrument that cut down
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:121335:44"/>the branches can cut up the root too; and if his reverence for which all the reſt was beleeved defend not their truth, it muſt needs at length utterly fail in his own. For all the autority they had was purely from him, and he falls in them before he falls in himſelf? no man can deny this that ſhall ſeriouſly lay his hand upon his heart, and ponder things as he ought. And he that once ceaſes to beleev in Chriſt whom before he worſhipped, I am ſure he will turn atheiſt if his wit and reaſon proceed conſequently and beleev nothing. A little more to ſpecify my meaning: If the inſtitutions of monaſteries to the praiſe and ſervice of God day and night, be thought as it hath been now theſe many years a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious folly; if Chriſtian Prieſts and ſacrifices be things of high idolatry, if the ſeven ſacraments be deemed vain moſt of them; if it ſuffice to ſalvation to beleev, what ever life we lead; if there be no value or merit in good works; if Gods laws be impoſſible to be kept; if Chriſt be not our law maker and directour of doing well, as well as redeemer from ill; if there be no ſacramental tribunal for our reconciliation ordained for us by Chriſt upon earth; if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al body of our Lord be not bequeathed unto his Spous in his laſt will and teſtament; if there be not under Chriſt a general head of the Church who is chief Prieſt and Paſtour of all Chriſtians upon earth under God, whoſe Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:121335:44"/>he is in ſpiritual affairs; all which things are now held forth by us manifeſtly againſt the doctrin of the firſt preachers of Chriſtianity in this land, then ſay I paganiſme was unjuſtly diſplaced by theſe doctrins, and atheiſm muſt needs ſucceed; for if Chriſt deceived us upon whom ſhall we rely; and if they that brought us the firſt news of Chriſt, brought along with it ſo many grand lyes, why may not the very ſtory of Chriſt himſelf be thought a Romance? And <hi>erunt noviſſima pejora prioribus,</hi> the latter condition of this land under atheiſm (catholick faith once utterly extirpated) muſt needs be far wors than it was in paganiſme before it was planted. Far ſweeter is that body, put caſe a ſtatue of ſtone that was never animated, than is any carkas of man after the ſoul is departed. And are not we in a wood now? who ſhall lead us out? The maze is made greater by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the multitude of ſects now reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt us; all which as they do unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly conſpire againſt that catholick Church they have deſerted, ſo do they wrangle now about every thing wherein they firſt agreed and conſpired againſt her, hating and execrating one another even unto war and bloodſhed, and the utter deſolation of our diſtreſſed nation. <hi>Quid eſt veritas,</hi> and on whoſe ſide is God all this while? does he not lie hid, and ſay nothing, and leav us wholly to our ſelvs by a judgment
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:121335:45"/>unſearchable in theſe our affairs, even as in other courſes of this world: Ith interim all opinions utter fine words, all preſume of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, all are peremptory, and cenſur not only their neighbours but even the whole earth round about. Where is truth? <hi>here</hi> ſaith one; nay not there, but <hi>here</hi> quoth another; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there nor there, but <hi>here</hi> ſaith a third: but ſo many <hi>heres</hi> and <hi>theres</hi> ſounds nothing to a rational man but either every where or no where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and which to conclude, is impoſſible for man of himſelf ſtedfaſtly to reſolv. <hi>Here is Chriſt and there is Chriſt</hi> in the judgment of Chriſt himſelf ſignifies neither here nor there. <hi>If they ſay ſaith our Lord, here is Chriſt or there is Chriſt, do not ye go forth or follow them:</hi> and the reaſon is very good, for the true Church wherein Chriſt really reſides, is ever in a poſture of quietneſs and defens. But they that go out of her and ſet up new wayes of their own are ever in clamour and diſſention, which of them ſhould do it beſt; and the cry is heard aloud and without ceas, <hi>Here, Here.</hi> Chriſt is here ſaith the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and not amongſt the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> nay quoth the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> by your favour, he is <hi>Here;</hi> nay then ſayes the <hi>Anabaptiſt, Here</hi> he is; if you be at that, quoth the <hi>Quaker.</hi> you are all blinded men, if any would find the true light com to us; for <hi>here</hi> it is and no where but <hi>here.</hi> But when all is done truth is not in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:121335:45"/>but unity, not in ſedition and clamour but meekneſs and peace. If ten men ſtand ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing in a ſtreet, and all agree that they ſee a thing there, but diſagree all in the deſcription of it, a ſtranger coming by will rather gueſs they are all mad, than that they ſee any thing at all. One thing I am ſure of; if all men would be humble minded and ſober, and caſt out of their hearts the great prejudice they have taken up againſt one another, they would ſee the better for it.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this ſubject (for I would ſay no more than what may help to lop the vain and ſuperfluous excreſcencies of faction and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about religion which perhaps none of us do rightly underſtand, and would be loth to cut the tree it ſelf to the quick) it may appear ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently by what I have ſaid, and yet far more if we joyn our own experimental knowledg and ratiocination of further things which I do pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely omit, that God is in himſelf an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable abyſs, and his eſſence and counſels paſt finding out; nay he is the great primo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial and father-abyſs of all others not to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached by angels or men, but according to ſuch few exteriour conceptions himſelf hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther revealed or imprinted in them, which be far from reaching home either to his counſels or proper eſſence. And who hath been his mate or counſellour that he ſhould tell us news of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:121335:46"/>him never heard before. If any news there be of him, it is ſurely to be had from Chriſt, whom we beleev to be his very ſubſtantial word and the ſplendour of his glory; and if Chriſt hath left any ſecrets of him to be revealed unto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, we muſt have them from his Church, which is the pillar and foundation and treaſury of all his truth; and if any Church is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, I ſhould think it ſhould be that, and only that which by an uninterrupted ſucceſſion hath deſcended from himſelf, which is that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame that firſt brought Chriſtian religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this land, which without all controverſy is the Catholick, now by contempt ſurnamed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt; and if any one be otherwiſe minded, <hi>etiam &amp; hoc Deus ipſi revelabit.</hi> In the mean time let us be peaceable and ſober.</p>

And although man ſees and knows enough in nature to make him admire and adore the Authour, yet not to contend with him in queſtions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies about it.

                  <p>Even the progreſs of a poor plant from its ſeed to its decay, who can declare or conceiv it? ſo many ſeveral ſeeds both of plants and animals, how do they ſhoot forth ſo orderly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:121335:47"/>their parts and organs, peculiar each one to themſelvs? where lies that celeſtial particle in the little ſeminal origen, which is the ſpring of life and motion in every thing? In the firſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogenial ſours how is diſtinguiſhed either kind from kinde, or part from part in the ſame kind; and which is that part that is to run forth into the head, and which into the arms, and how is it done? I ſee wheat and barley, elm and oak, hors and man to ſhoot up conſtantly each one from their own ſeed, in their own proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar mode and method; and perhaps an angel or intelligence may diſtinctly ſee the reaſon of all in the very ſeeds, (for ſom reaſon is certainly there to be ſeen) but what man can do it? how comes ſuch variety of bulk, parts, odour and colour unto flowers; there is a reaſon it muſt needs be ſo and no otherwis than ſo; what is it? Be there, put caſe, a thouſand plants upon earth, much mineral and metal within it, huge variety of birds and fiſh, and beaſts about it, what is it we know of all this, from the egge to the apple. If the earths ſemidiameter be three or four thouſand miles, what lies hid in all that vaſt boſom?

                  <p>How comes the crumbling earth to be made to flow in tenacious liquid ſtreams, ſo rare and yet ſo ſtrangely compact, that water even in a bottle can hardly be crowded nearer. What is the true nature of air, and the etherial limits: The earth and ſun which of them moves about the other? and why within the limits of the zodiaque. What is the order in that camp of glory over our heads? are the ſtars like the ſtones in the ſtreet, without any rank as they ſeem to our eye? and what are they? holes in a ſolid firmament where the glimpſes of glory above dart forth unto the eyes of mortals, or ſolid bodies themſelvs, and all ſuſpended in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid air as our earth is: and what ſuſtains either our earth or them? what ſhoves them on ſo equally in their cours? do they move daily
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:121335:48"/>through all that vaſt expans, ſo that they muſt neceſſarily fly ſo many thouſands of our miles in one hours ſpace as we conceiv; or is that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ingendred in us by our own motion either upon our own or the worlds axletree? what creatures live there: or be there in the univers no other corporal intellectual creature but man in this our earthly ſyſtem, to ſerv contemplate and bleſs that infinite holy one who is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver and caus of all things. A man of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf might eaſily doubt it: for it makes more to the glory of that great bleſſed Being, that he ſhould be enjoyed praiſed and ſerved in worlds innumerable, under innumerable degrees of perfection, by creatures, intellectual of ſeveral modes conſtitutions and excellencies, rather than onely in this one world of ours; a world of known ignorance and darknes, a world of ſin and malice, that probably may lie under ſom unknown malediction (it knows not his own weal, and as little heeds it when it is known) a world of much naughtines, and ſo far alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from God and true piety and peace, that Origen ſeems not irrationally to conceit it to be a hous of correction for offendours, delivered up for ſom ſpace unto the prince of darknes (not much beſide the fanſy of good S. Paul who was as good a philoſopher as divine) to inveigle harraſs and plague us for a ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>This book of the creation or volum of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:121335:49"/>Gods works is a noble and moſt excellent bible, opened to us here on earth altho in part only for our exerciſe, being intellectual indeed but the moſt infantile intellect that can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, opened I ſay to us to look on, as little children upon a primer, whoſe letters they ſee but know none of them, nor yet their connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or end; to other more excellent corporeal creatures in the ſtars above (if any there be) for further underſtanding and knowledg, and to incorporeal intelligences for a more abſolute ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. But our looking upon the world is not to be meerly ſenſual and exteriour, as a hors or a cow looks up to the ſun, but a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory and affectionate ſpeculation (if we will have it a humane action) our want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg being ſupplied by love, in admiring that power whoſe works we ſee indeed but cannot comprehend.</p>
                  <p>Hence it might not irrationally be beleeved, although religion were ſilent, that the ſoul of man is ſurely immortal; and that an intellect ſuch as mans is, being admitted by his creatour to a rational ſight of his works (as all know ours is, and the bruits is not) ſhall at length he tranſlated unto ſome better ſtate of more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and comprehenſiv knowledg both of his works and providence and eſſence too which here we cannot attain. For ſo we uſe to put little books into the hands of our infant chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:121335:49"/>when they can make little more uſe of them than a bruit, to accuſtom them to the outward ſight of that they ſhall afterward in their riper growth more fully underſtand: but we do not the like to young whelps or fawns, altho at their birth they ſeem far more mature than one of our ſlavering babes, becaus the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſuch creaturs will in no ſtate be able to reach the knowledg. Hence I ſay may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a ſuſpicion of our ſouls immortality, which is afterward ſtrengthened by religion and philoſophy. The beaſts of the field ſee nothing but their food; but man ſees, that is, conſiders and admires all things viſible and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; I mean in his human life and operation: for man is ſo ſet in the horizon of eternity and corruption, that he may betake himſelf unto which life he pleaſes either human or beſtial; and it is in his power either to make himſelf a beaſt or angel; this, by ſuperiour and intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual; that, by inferiour and ſenſual propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thoughts and operations: but with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that a created angel or intelligence ſhall ſtill have a greater amplitude of intellect by precedency of nature, and exacter clearnes of thought by ſegregation from all matter, but a made angel or the ſpirit of man angelized, may have notwithſtanding through the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his combate a greater crown of glory and comfort at the feet of his maker.</p>

                  <p>NOt to wander from my purpos. The gulf of the creation is indeed but a ſecondary abyſs and nearer to our feeling but far from our comprehenſion: ſith we neither know the nature of thoſe viſible bodies we behold both above and below us, nor the manner of their firſt riſe when they ſtarted out of their ancient nothing, nor their dependances one upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, nor their motions, nor the limit and extent either of the elements and ſtars, or of all the univers together.</p>
                  <p>For is the world finite! where ends it? in the higheſt ſtars? who can tell if we were there, but that our eye ſhould ſtill diſcover other new glittering ſyſtems at as great a diſtance from us then, as theſe be now; and ſo forward without end. If we imagin an edge or outward rim of the univers, let us conceiv (as it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible) that a man were ſet there and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his being; where ſhould his head be? out of the world, and no where? could he there think or ſpeak or put forth his finger or caſt a ſtone, and all this in nothing, and beyond the whole univers; can an imaginary thing be as capable of reall action as naturall place? Is God really there beyond all this univers, or no?
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:121335:50"/>if not, then muſt he be limited to the extenſion of his works, and his immenſity as much confined as they: if he be really there as he is here, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee but that it is as reall a place as this wherin the world ſtands, namely if we take place not according to the definition of Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <hi>ultimum continentis,</hi> &amp;c. (which deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on provides well for the placeing of a hous or tree, not at all for the univers which according to that deſcription is in no place at all) but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true and genuin nature of place, as it is the immovable baſis of a body penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and penetrated by it; for this is the true reaſon of primary abſolute and eſſential place; whereas Ariſtotle deſcribes onely that which is ſecondary, accidental and relative; eſſential place is naturally before any body placed in it, accidental deſcribed by Ariſtotle muſt needs be after ſome body, being a relation of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the contained body. And laſtly if the world be finite, as mans underſtanding is more prone to think (becaus of the incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in reaſon apprehended in a ſuppoſal of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity not indeed to be graſped by mans intellect) who can ſay where the incongruities be greater? about an infinite ſomething, or an infinite no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? if the world be finite in its real being, the imaginary or no being muſt be infinite; where alſo, it is as poſſible for Gods unlimited power to place worlds without end, as he hath
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:121335:51"/>done this here. Who dare ſay he cannot do it, who can ſay he has not done it. This then is abſolutely uncertain unto us as we are left to our ſelves and not to be defined by man. Nor do the reaſons produced by philoſophers againſt the worlds infinity inferre any greater abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then a finite world inferrs, perhaps leſs: and if thoſe reaſons be well pried into, we ſhall finde that generally thoſe philoſophers endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſhow the abſurdities of a real cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorematical infinity which we cannot graſp, do notwithſtanding ſo argue againſt it as if they had graſped it; which is a great and ordinary fallacy in all their arguments againſt infinity ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of time or magnitude. I intend not here to maintain any thing but onely this, that our reaſon left to it ſelf can certainly make out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe innumerable ſhining lights we behold in the firmament there glittering and twinkling without ceas, S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> doubted if they were not beatified bodies wherein glorified creaturs might have their reſidence in bliſs: and we may doubt it ſtill for aught I know. Were thoſe huge bodies of glory in their ſeveral ſtations and magnitudes made onely for us to ſleep by? we can mean no other, when we ſay ſo confidently, that all the whole univers was made onely for our uſe? For our uſe, I doubt not, ſome part in one kind, ſom in another; but to ſay or
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:121335:51"/>think only for our uſe, the uſe we now make of it is in my mind but a weakiſh fanſy. The ſun moon and other planets we know ſom uſe of; but of the ſtars in the firmament, little or none at all, but onely for our wonderment. What needed ſo many for our uſe? why of that divers magnitude, ſith candles all of a bignes would have been both more handſom and convenient: why in that uncouth ſcituation, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt wit can make no more of it, than childrens imagination of phantaſtick ſhapes in the clouds: why thouſands ſo obſcure that hardly diſcernable, and likely thouſand others ſeldom or never ſeen by us at all. And what is the uſe we have of them? do they make our ſleeps ſounder, or our dreams more or leſs? do not the beaſts of the field, eſpecially thoſe of prey, make more uſe of them than man, who is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly going to bed after the ſun, when the wild beaſts go forth to their prey by ſtarlight: and amongſt men the better any one is, the leſs uſe hath he of the ſtars; for the drunkard theef and adulterer do their works generally by night. The greateſt uſe I know we have of thoſe glorious bodies, is to rais us up to a devout contemplation of that inviſible and almighty Being, from whence did iſſue ſo many viſible glories of himſelf: for to ſay thoſe firmament ſtars ſerv for the effecting alteration of ſtates and kingdoms, tranſlation of empires,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:121335:52"/>wars and peace, civility and barbariſm, religion, deluges and the like, is a meer ungrounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectur; ſith all theſe things might be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promoted by the inferiour planets and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of others cauſes for aught any one can tell, without any ſtar in the firmament at all: and yet even thoſe uſes are but very ſmall and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable for ſuch vaſt bodies to be only ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, if truly aſſerted. One uſe is certain, to rais us to the meditation of things inviſible, and to lead us up by degrees, (even as themſelvs are ſeated one above another) like ſo many greeces in the ethereal expans, unto that hidden Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who is the caus of all. And this is for us who have all our neceſſities otherwayes ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied uſe enough; but he that therefor thinks they have no other uſe in themſelvs becaus they ſerv us in this, is but yet in his young thoughts and ſees not beyond his own untutoured ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
                  <p>For conſidering that thoſe glorious bodies are even in our demonſtrated and uncontrouled reaſon as exeſſively more ſpecious and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſo alſo far greater than our whole globe of earth wherein we live, even twenty ſold ſome of them and upwards, why ſhould all thoſe vaſt capacities be in vain? Why may not we rather think intellectuall ſubſtances reſident therein with bodies more and leſs refined, in degrees and modes and faſhions to us altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:121335:52"/>who might chant out the praiſes of the almighty <hi>One,</hi> in meaſures anſwerable to their condition without end? can this ſeem to any man unreaſonable? ſo the ancient wiſe men among the Pagans, <hi>Democritus, Pythagoras,</hi> and ſeveral other great Philoſphers conceived, for the greater honour and glory of the firſt caus: and ſhall they be more zealous of Gods glory than we; or ſhall we Chriſtians be the onely hidebound Philoſophers in the world not able to conceiv any thing beyond the eye and imagination of a child.</p>
                  <p>The eminent french Philoſopher <hi>De Cartes</hi> conceited the twinkling ſtars we ſee and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable others we diſcover not, to be in their ranks and places, as ſo many ſuns in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, about which move Planets or bodies unto us here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> altogether inviſible, except we either riſe higher or they deſcend towards us in their motion, warmed and vegetated by their fires as we by our ſun; If it be thus, as well it may for aught I can know of my ſelf, what a ſtrange conſort of hymnes and praiſes riſe up in the univers, continually and without ceas as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens, in ſeveral keys of muſick unto that great <hi>holy One</hi> who made us all, to ſupply the defects of thoſe ſmall pittiful ſervices we poor worms perform unto him, in this our earthly ſyſtem! This may ſeem far more rationall thank to think that we groſs corporeall creatures and ſenſuall
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:121335:53"/>ſinners, are the only people in the univers who ſerv the almighty, and that all thoſe eminent bright ſhining ſyſtems above us, whoſe order, method, properties, bulk and nature is ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, are there ſet and appointed for nothing elſe but onely for our uſe, which we cannot yet ſay what it is; and when we have imagined our utmoſt, is not of the value of any one ſtar in the firmament; or that bodies of their vaſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity ſhould be utterly empty and have no creature at all within them.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould of my ſelf be ſo far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the ſtars of the firmament are onely for our uſe; that I ſhould doubt whether the very elements amongſt which we live and breath, earth, aier, and water, and the beaſts minerals and plants contained in them, are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made to ſerv us, tho chiefly intended for our benefit. The very gradual perfections of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath in it ſelf a worth and decency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming the Creatour, tho man had never been? And if all had been onely aimed for our uſe, would not a leſs ſea have ſerved our turn, and fewer birds beaſts fiſh and plants. What uſe have we of all the great depth of earth under us to the center, or larg vaſt aether about us. And if we were ſuch abſolute lords of the world as we conceiv our ſelves to be, how is it that nothing at all in natur is at our command? not the ſea, not the aier, not the earth it ſelf,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:121335:53"/>nor any thing upon it or in it, will either come or go, or alter, or ſtop his courſe at our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: which King <hi>Canutus</hi> obſerved well, when ſtanding with his nobles by the Thames ſide, he perceived the tide to ruſh upon him, altho he had commanded it to com no nearer. What kind of vaſſails be theſe inferiour natures under man, that will obey us in juſt nothing? Beſides, when any one is abſolute maiſter of a hous, wholly deſtined to his uſe, ſurely ſuch a one can go and com into any room thereof without controul; but let man walk down either into the bottom of his ſeas to ſee his fiſh there, or into the cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of his earth amongſt the mettals, and tell me if he be not ſtifled as ſoon as other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: But if he once attempt to mount the upper rooms of his habitation, tho it be but into the firſt or ſecond region of the aier, he ſhall fail at the very firſt ſtep; for his ethereal greeces will not bear the groſs unweildly bulk of their Lord: ſo ill is the houſe fitted for the maiſters conſtitution from the very top to the bottom. Can we not honour and bleſs God for the uſe he hath lent us of all theſe things which is great and various, but we muſt by the vanity of our hearts appropriate and monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſe the univers to our ſelvs, as if it were for no other uſe at all but ours.</p>
                  <p>The manifold uſe and ſervices we have of the ſtars and elements, beaſts, birds, fiſh and plants,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:121335:54"/>which do all adminiſter unto man in ſomthing or other, according to the exigence either of his neceſſities thence to be ſupplied, or his corporal delight, or mental ſpeculation to be furniſhed from that great body, which the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodnes therefor made before man that in the firſt inſtant of his being he ſhould want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ought to make us thankful but not proud. And ſo the holy prophet, admiring the excellency and perfection of place that mankind by his creators goodnes hath over other viſible creatures amongſt whom he livs; and the various uſes he hath of them, doth in one of his ſweet pſalms invite man thereupon to magnifie this his great benefactour, who ſet him in ſo high a place when he needed not to have put him in any: and if man do ſo he ſhall do well. But he muſt not appropriate more to himſelf than is given, or inſtead of being thankful for the dominion he has received, vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceit a dominion he has not.</p>
                  <p>Ariſtotle fanſied our earth to be the center of the Univers, and the ſtars to be a ſift eſſence differing from all the four elements placed in the circumference: but the great wits of the world that lived before him, <hi>Pythagoras, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedocles, Anaxagoras, Democritus, Epicure,</hi> were of another mind. And although our Chriſtian Schoolmen have now for five of ſix hundred years explicated and defended the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:121335:54"/>of their religion even in the way of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle by which for a thouſand years it had been oppoſed by the pagan, yet do they not intend to mix his philoſophy with thoſe principles of their faith: nor does the great Chriſtian Church therefore canoniſe his philoſophy for truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus ſhe ſuffers her own truths to be declared and explicated by it. If Chriſtianity be true, it fears no antagoniſts; but will bear the teſt of any right philoſophy: but yet philoſophy that it may be right indeed, muſt be corrected and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by this divine truth, as well as this explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſom things by it. And if another Chriſtian philoſopher ſhould explicate his faith now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, in the way of <hi>Democritus</hi> or <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> as in the firſt times of the Church it was declared in the way of <hi>Plato,</hi> and in theſe latter ages by <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> ſo he do it piouſly and warily, and ſquare not his rule of faith by them, but them by it; I cannot ſee why it may not commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be done. But then as he does uſe thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to ſatisfy a pythagorean or epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; ſo muſt he confidently reject as diſſonant to right reaſon, what he finds unapt to ſquare with the received truths of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as we do now deal with <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> This if it were done; as Chriſtian religion will be juſtified, when it is perceived to ſtand with the right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of any Philoſophy: ſo likewiſe when an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Philoſophy contrary to Ariſtotles is once underſtood, all the whole univers both for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:121335:55"/>weight, and meaſure, its eſſences, relations, concatenation, origin, life, and qualities would hang as looſe, ſuſpence, and doubtful as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had been ever ſaid of it. <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will make <hi>Democritus</hi> and his diſciples doubted: and again, the great learning and ſubtility of <hi>Democritus, Anaxagoras, Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Empedocles</hi> will as much diſable <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> and the doubt may be as pregnant among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as other men, where the catholick Church interpoſes not the autority of ſome received tradition to caſt the ſcales. But whether ſhe do this or no, is not to my purpos now in hand, who intend onely to inſinuate unto ſuch as mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply opinions about religion both without and againſt that Church, that even nature it ſelf is vaſtly obſcure and unknown to man who lives in it, and nothing in a manner, but only what enters our ſenſes, can be ſo certainly known and concluded by any, that he may prudently either ſwagger or fight for his opinion. And religion and the things of another world muſt needs be yet more obſcure than thoſe of this.</p>
                  <p>It is obſervable, that Chriſt and Moſes, and other holy Apoſtles and Prophets, when in their diſcours they touch incidentally upon things of nature, (their chief purpos being ever to teach the way of vertue and true piety) they comply oftentimes to the capacity and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the hearer, what ever it be. So Chriſt our Lord told us, that at the finall day, the ſtars
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:121335:55"/>ſhall fall from heaven, inſinuating by that amongſt his other expreſſions, the great diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of nature then to happen; wherein co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, which the vulgar calls ſtars, may ſhoot indeed, but the Philoſophers ſtars cannot fall upon us out of the firmament, except all return to the old Chaos, and one Syſtem mix with another. Moſes calls the ſun and moon the two greater lights, and the ſtars of the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the leſſer, altho contrary to philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call truth, when he intended to declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people that have vulgarly ſuch concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them, that ſun and moon and all the other ſtars and planets were created by that God he revealed. The Pſalmiſt under the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of an Eagle which renews his youth, expreſſes moral renovation; which he might well do, ſith men had ſo fanſied of the eagle, whether indeed he do ſo or not. The like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance was uſed by him, who told the people that the ſtars in their ranks fought againſt their enemies, in which phraſe he inſinuated Gods providence in battles, condeſcending to the peoples imagination, who looked upon the ſtars as a pitched field of champions under the Lord of thoſe hoſts of heaven to defend the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. Thus leaving us in the ſame imagination about things of nature they found us in, they endeavoured all of them onely to chalk us out the right way unto that felicity, whereof the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:121335:56"/>knowledg of theſe and other wonderments of Gods power ſhall be the leaſt part; by ſerving him as we ought from whom have iſſued pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies we ſhall never know in this life, and who is himſelf the wonder of all wonders onely to be ſeen and known in the other.</p>
                  <p>Having ſeriouſly peruſed the Schools and learning of the ancient Pagan Philoſophers, this I finde, that their diſciples however conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their demonſtration and knowledg, did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beleev than know any thing: and the firſt maiſter invented himſelf (properly ſpeaking) not ſo much a philoſophy as faith. Take <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> and his School on one ſide; <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Epicure</hi> on the other: theſe two ſchools were mainly oppoſite both in their principles and whole body of learning. And yet none that underſtand them well can tell by any ſtrength of nature or force of their arguments, which of them is with truth. According to learned <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Epicure,</hi> all things began in time by a fortuite concours of atomes, which in all eternity filled the immenſity of ſpace; and as theſe made the world, ſo do they by their inceſſant mobility work continually inſenſible alterations, till after long time they fly all aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der again, and make caſually another world ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here again, or in ſom other part of the immens ſpace, quite of another mode and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion unto this; ſo that matter upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:121335:56"/>is all and does all. According to <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> the world had no beginning, but partiall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations daily, wherin form gives the act and eſſence, and matter is ſo far from being all, that it is but a pure potentiallity and <hi>prope nihil,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt juſt nothing. Theſe were the oppoſite principles of two differing Philoſophies. But were they known or evident to either of the maiſters? If they had ſought for an argument to prove them, they had laboured in vain: one therfor conceited that matter was all things, the other that matter was nothing, &amp;c. and upon this conceit which nothing but the auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the maiſter to whom they would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here, faſtened upon the diſciples, they raiſed a Philoſophy, which being thus founded upon a human faith or fanſy, all their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ratiocinations could never effect that it ſhould be rather called knowledg than beleef or fantoſme.</p>
                  <p>And this is the reaſon why the ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prieſts grave and learned men, who had entertained an eſteem of their maiſter above all mortall men, would never give way that the articles of Chriſtian faith ſhould be tried by the principles either of Ariſtotelian or Epicurean beleef; and ſince the diſciples of thoſe men would adhere ſo firmly to fals and indemonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted principles of human teachers, they thought it much more reaſonable that they ſhould hold
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:121335:57"/>conſtantly what they had received from a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine maiſter, and not ſubmit to the teſt of ſuch ungrounded inevident and contradicting prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of men as much oppoſite one to another, as all perhaps to Chriſtian faith, even Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles philoſophy as well as the reſt. What more aſſured pillars be there in Ariſtotles ſchool than theſe. <hi>Ex nihilo nihil fit,</hi>

And yet thoſe catholik prieſts perceived well enough, that Chriſtian princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were contrary unto theſe, and theſe to them; the firſt to creation; the ſecond to the ſouls immortality; the third to the Trinity; fourth to the Euchariſt, fifth to the Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſixth to the reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>Some ages after roſe our Chriſtian philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers (whom we commonly call Schoolmen) and raiſed a fine piece of art upon Chriſtian principles defended and made good even in Ariſtotles way. And theſe, becaus the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named and ſuch other Ariſtotelian axioms car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a plauſible appearance of truth in the ear, they did accept them indeed, but in a ſens of their own; ſo that they do not in this Chriſtian ſchool make out that ſens they did in the others, though they bear the ſame ſound. And it is
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:121335:57"/>pretty to ſee, how one and the ſame axiom is made in ſeveral ſchools to butteres up waies that be deſtructive to one another. God made the world in time ſaith the Chriſtian, and none but he could do it; for it is not in the power of any creature no not of the higheſt intelligence to make a thing of nothing, for <hi>ex nihilo nihil fit,</hi> of nothing is nothing made, namely by the power and force of nature, though it may by God the firſt caus; ſo ſpeaks he. The world is eternal ſaith Ariſtotle and could not be made in time, either by the meeting of atomes, for their concours is diſorderly and caſuall, and <hi>opus naturae opus intelligentiae,</hi> nor yet by the firſt caus himſelf out of pure nothing, for <hi>ex nihilo nihil fit,</hi> of nothing can nothing be made, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by God or nature, The world is not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſaith Epicure, but made in time without the aſſiſtance of any deity; which if any there be muſt be ever at reſt, out of the eternall matter of ever moving atomes; it muſt be made ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them or of nothing, and <hi>ex nihilo nihil fit,</hi> of nothing can nothing be made; and the ſame atomes by their own connaturall mobility do make and marre, do and undo all things. In theſe and a thouſand ſuch like conteſts that employ the world, does not a credulity once fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fill up both the pages of the book? and all conſequent ratiocination, diſputes and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are they any thing els but colourable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:121335:58"/>of this fore-conceived inevident cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity? Since then all ſciences ſtand upon ſom one or other baſis of beleef, (which is a <hi>poſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum</hi> not to be examined) this world may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be eſteemed credulous but not knowing: and all maiſters of any whatever ſchools have equall need to ſet this motto over their ſchool doors, <hi>Oportet diſcentem credere.</hi> He that will learn muſt beleeve; and when he has learned all truths can be taught him, he does but only beleev that he had learned any. And ſo I take my leav of this ſecond great abyſs of nature.</p>

                  <p>THe third and laſt abyſs, is the great gulf of Gods Providence in the government of the world, equally as deep and unfoardable by man as the former, (tho we may ſometimes perceiv ſome little glimmerings of it as an owl of the ſun, but even theſe are uncertain and doubtful) and it is ſo much the more perillous, than either of the reſt; for that in the other, and in particular that of his works we follow Gods power wiſdom and goodneſs, ſo much the more admiring all things by how much the leſs we underſtand; but in this we are apt to call every thing in queſtion, and our thoughts if they be not well bridled ready at every turn to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:121335:58"/>accuſe God and plead againſt him and cite him to judgment, to the peril of his heavy diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And therefor he did very cautiouſly and wiſely, who finding a doubt to riſe within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf concerning providence, ſubſcribed before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to Gods inerrable juſtice, before he would enter into any parly about his proceedings, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus es Domine</hi> ſaith he, Juſt art thou O Lord, but why doth the way of the wicked proſper.</p>
                  <p>Is there any man lives upon earth from the loweſt hinde to the higheſt philoſopher, that hath not perceived the depth of providence, and the abſolute inſcrutability of Gods wayes in the government of the whole creation, as a gulf without bottom where reſignation adores and preſumption drowns. My thoughts have frequently hovered upon the ſhore of this ocean, but I durſt never paſs further on, than ſo far as I ſaw ground, there dipping my hands and feet (to follow God and pray) but no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: nor did I ever receiv from any writings of diſcours of man any ſatisfaction therein: and none I expect.</p>
                  <p>For what are thoſe immortal laws God hath fixedly preſcribed, either to the earth elements or ſtars, which they never tranſgreſs, who is it can tell? They are many no doubt, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; in order to him the firſt caus, in order to the ſeveral things contained within them, and in order to one another; for they muſt all make
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:121335:59"/>up one great Pan or univers, be it never ſo big. And all things doubtles within the whole body of this univers, are don regularly truly and juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to the preſcribed idea rule and meaſure, the will order and law of the firſt caus diſpoſer and governour, who is the way truth and life to all the whole creation.</p>
                  <p>What the angels know hereof cannot be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conjectured, nor whether any one be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and univerſal overſeer under God of the whole viſible creation It may ſeem not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that if any intelligence ſtand limited to the overſight and guidance of any one place, put caſe our earth or a ſtar, that he may not know the laws of another no further than they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern his own ſyſtem; nay perhaps not all the laws of his own, but ſuch onely as himſelf is to mannage; for even ſome of theſe which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern him not to uſe, may lye covert in that great will on whoſe revelation every intellect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends: and thus a miracle may be wrought by God almighty, even beſide or contrary to the cours of nature which is adminiſtred by angels. But man, he knows none of theſe laws, no not any; let him exalt himſelf never ſo much in his own vanity, he knows not, I ſay, any of thoſe rules by which either the whole univers or our own earth and elements are governed.</p>
                  <p>Man is of a certain the higheſt creature viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon earth, and the moſt excellent ſpecies
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:121335:59"/>known to our eyes; but who can therefor ſay there be not others above him, more knowing and more powerful than he, and more conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in the government even of this our viſible world, tho they appear not to our ſight. We have indeed a preheminence of perfection but not of operation over any thing in nature; which is a ſuperiority natural not moral. And therefor in all probability there muſt be ſom creatur over us with both the precedencies, far more perfect then any under them, and guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo the motions of all well known to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; if namely God have committed the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of this preſent world unto any other under his own influence and ordination. St. Paul ſeems to conceit that theſe ſpirits are evil ones, whom he calls <hi>rectores tenebrarum harum,</hi> but there muſt be good ones too, to moderate the ill influence of thoſe malign agents, or els man that lives upon earth is in a ſad condition.</p>
                  <p>But as for us, what do we know of all this for certain, or what can we do? we can neither rais a wind nor any other meteor, nor aſſwage the ſea, nor ſtill an earthquake, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not only deſtitute of power to do it, but alſo of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg how it ſhould be done. There be many creaturs under us, that is to ſay, inferiour in perfection of nature, as birds beaſts and plants, but they are not under us at all either in directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:121335:60"/>or ſubordination of motion. We neither teach the birds to build their neſt, or to ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or provide for their young, or put forth the wing to flight, or to appear and hide themſelvs in their ſeaſon; nor the fiſh to ſwim, to get food and defence againſt annoiances, or to chooſe their reſort and ſtations in the liquid main, or thoſe ſeveral wayes they have for multiplication and livelihood; nor do we put the fanſy into the bee or little ant to work their tasks in ſeaſon, with the art and induſtry they ſhow in it; nor do we move the plants to their growth and ripenes, nor do we know our ſelves how theſe or any other things in nature are wrought: Thus deſtitute are we of any rules of providence whereby this world is either ſet or kept in order; that we neither preſcribe them, nor ſee them obſerved, or do our ſelves underſtand them: we are neither called to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe for the ordering of the being of things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us, or is our help required for their conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or our ſuffrage demanded for the putting a period to their exiſtences.</p>
                  <p>And are not we in the mean time goodly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and diſpoſers of the world, that have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand in the making or guiding of it. I knew once an innocent that took a fanſy in his brain, that he was maſter and diſpoſer of all the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens that came up in barges and lighters by a river that ran through the town, and would
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:121335:60"/>conſtantly be upon the bridg at the hour they were to unload, where ſtanding very ſerious and attentive, as ſoon as he ſaw the porters to carry forth out of any barge a burden of coal or corn or other proviſion, he ſtill bad them aloud and with autority to take it, and carry it that way which he ſaw them inclined to go, and all the day long he was never diſobeyed. Such maſters and governours are we of this world, with power to bid a bird to fly, or ant to creep, or wolf to run, or heavens to move even as we ſee they do; and ſo we are obeyed and no otherwayes; nor no otherwayes do we know either what they will or ought to do. We do indeed feed upon ſom creatures, we either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare or which ſtand tame to our hands, and tirannize over ſom others, ſubjugating them either by ſubtilty or force will they nill they to our yoke: but this is no more than the beaſt fiſh and birds do to one another.</p>
                  <p>And as for the ebbing and flowing of thoſe ſeveral events and accidents that be proper only unto man, as peace and war, wealth and pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, arts, policy, religion and the like; what a labyrinth is he in, that enters into conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their varieties and cauſes, the ends and motives of them. If religion be a thing ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our ſalvation, how is it that our good God left the gentiles for ſo many hundred years all over the face of the earth, to walk after the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:121335:61"/>errours of their mind, in the blindnes and darknes of their underſtanding? what had they done before they were born to deſerv it; and if they be ſo dealt withal without deſert, how does Gods juſtice appear. And again, if a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular religion be not neceſſary, for example the Chriſtian; why did Chriſt our Lord put thoſe poor harmles men his apoſtles to ſo many labours, neceſſities, and dangers of death, to plant it in the world. And how comes it, that even this religion now revealed and preacht in the world makes ſo ſmall progres, and brings forth ſo little fruit among us. Why ſhould the Turk and his alcoran caſt forth the only true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion out of all his Territories, where it did once ſo gloriouſly triumph and fructifie, <hi>Syria, Egypt, Africa, Greece,</hi> and hereſies and ſchiſms out of other places.</p>
                  <p>The aſſurance of our own ſouls immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would conduce not a little to the exciting of our dull and drowſy ſpirits, unto a more quick and lively care of our future bliſs; and ſo dull we are and doubtfull of all things, that it were almoſt neceſſary we had it, and yet we are, God wot, ſo far from that, that we even doubt our ſelves, whether we our ſelves have any thing immortal in us: nor is there left an argument in reaſon to convince us of it? Is it not a ſtrang thing that man the moſt excellent of creatures upon earth ſhould be ſo left to his own diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:121335:61"/>to turn and ſwarve as he pleaſes, either to right hand or left, and by that means to fill the earth with injurious diſorders and enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſin, which might as well have ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained innocent and peaceable, and all other creatures both above and below us, go on order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their cours preſcribed by their maker with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any irregularity or deviation. Does not every good maiſter of a hous, keep his whole family in order if he can and know how to do it? And God wants neither wiſdom power or goodnes, that he ſhould be either not deſirous or ignorant or not able to make all actually good: What chain of cauſes known to man may unriddle theſe things</p>
                  <p>Are not all things in daily change both to Kingdoms in general. and each mans particular perſon, both in matter of fame, wealth, power, and other accidents? But how do all theſe things happen as they do: what is the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate caus efficient, what the final, where doth the juſtice appear? Hiſtories tell us of little elſe but warres, battles, deſolations, deluges, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of empires, the riſe and downfall of kingdoms in their power, renown, and civility; alteration of ſtates and lawes, ſucceſſion of deepeſt barbariſme to moſt high civility, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of moſt exquiſite civility unto horrideſt barbariſme, mutation of languages, peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, oppreſſion and liberties of people, &amp;c. By
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:121335:62"/>what lawes of the almighty are all theſe things ordered, and what juſtice infers ſuch heaps of miſery upon feeble mankind; eſpecially ſince we ſee even with our eyes that all invaſion which ſets afoot the greateſt and moſt oecumenick changes is generally unjuſt?</p>
                  <p>If we do but only conſider the horrid turmoils, that have been at times in our own countrey by the Romans and Brittons, Brittons and Saxes, Saxes and Normans, Scotch and Engliſh, the two houſes of York and Lancaſter; nay but the meer troubles of theſe laſt twenty years from 1640. to 1660. whereof we have been ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and ſufferers, (nor will there any pen be able to ſet down the miſeries we have undergone) wherein rebellion prevailed over loialty, diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation over truth, tenant over Lord, ſubject over King, even to the murdering of that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred perſon by a pretended form of juſtice, in the face of the world, without any caus exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt him, but only his own defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their rebellion, and the depriving his loi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſubjects of their eſtates, liberties and lives, ſouldiers all the land over hovering daily over our heads, like ravens over ſick and dying bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, &amp;c. What juſtice, what providence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to us in all theſe things: Are we not as blind as beetles to diſcern it? The iniquity of man we underſtand well enough, but Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in ſo ordering or permitting it, who can
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:121335:62"/>diſcern? and yet there is doubtles a reaſon in heaven for all.</p>
                  <p>What diſtinction appears in this world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the juſt man and unjuſt? ſave that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes and honeſty for the moſt part goes to the worſt. Is it not a myſtery, that ſo many innocent ſouls, perſons of moſt exact vertue and good conſcience, both towards God and man, ſhould walk up and down many of them hungry and half ſtarved, traduced and comfortles, of whom the world is not worthy; whereas the ſlighteſt of men, even vanity and ſenſuality it ſelf vaunts it in ſilks and fulnes of all plenty.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould be infinite, if I ſhould ſpecify the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable uncouth changes and chances in this world; all which carry no reaſon or equity at all in their forehead. The ſtories of empires and kingdoms from the beginning of time to this day, the records of all provinces, the lives of all particular perſons in the world, are all but little draughts and epitomies of this great amazement; all whoſe cauſes ſince they be ſo utterly unknown to us, that we can diſcern no reaſon or right for them, it appears that we know of our ſelvs as little of this great abyſs as of the former. And it concerns us, I ſhould think, not to be puffed up as generally we are in our opinions, but to humble our ſelves (wherein conſiſts our greateſt wiſdom) before the great creatour and governour of the world,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:121335:63"/>as well in this as other ſecrets altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable, and ſay; Surely thou O Lord art juſt and wiſe and entirely upright in all thy wayes, altho we worms underſtand it not; for <hi>ſhall not the judg of all the world do right.</hi> Shall not he do right himſelf that judges and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes every creature for their iniquity and wrong. This is an abyſs that hath in it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amazement but danger; and therefor I leave it more willingly.</p>
                  <p>Thus God both in himſelf, and works and providence is a triple great abyſs, altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable by man; as we may in a manner ſee by all has been hitherto ſaid, and much more to that purpoſe reſerved to thoughts and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. But the more to ſtrengthen my aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will conclude this matter with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of autority, which coming now into my mind I cannot totally omit. To the unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the firſt abyſs, which is God in himſelf, that great prophet atteſts, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims him to be a <hi>hidden God,</hi> a God that hides and conceals himſelf, <hi>God ſaviour of Iſrael;</hi> and no leſs that grave Apoſtle; who profeſſes of this great God, that he <hi>inhabites light unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible:</hi> though it be light, yet whiles it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible light, we are never the near to ſee it. To the unfoardablenes of the ſecond he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes that was eſteemed the wiſeſt of men; to the other one of the holieſt: The wiſe man
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:121335:63"/>ſpeaks thus. <hi>Vide afflictionem quam dedit Deus filiis hominum,</hi> &amp;c. I ſaw an affliction which God hath laid upon the ſons of men, that they ſhould be rackt in it; he made all things good in their time, and gave up the world to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of men, that man might not find out the work which God hath wrought from the beginning even to the end. Men talk and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of Gods works: but what is the event? to find out ſomthing ſurely, tho it be but little; nay, nay, if we may beleev wiſe Salomon to find out nothing even juſt nothing from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end: and who would not wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and diſturb the whole univers, about ſuch diſputes as theſe, where opponent and reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conclude nothing: And that the world might not think this ſpeech of his to be haſty or leſs conſidered, he repeats it again after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: <hi>Intellexi</hi> ſaith he <hi>quod omnium operum Dei nullam poſſit homo invenire rationem eorum quae fiunt ſub ſole, &amp; quanto plus laboraverit ad quaerendum, tanto minus inveniat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> etiamſi dixerit ſapiens ſe noſſe, non poterit. reperire.</hi> The holy man of the third abyſs, which is of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and ordination of things, ſpeaks thus: <hi>O altitudo divitiarum,</hi> &amp;c. O the height and depth of the riches of the ſapience and ſcience of God, how incomprehenſible are his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and his wayes unſearchable! Who hath known the ſens of our Lord, or who hath been
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:121335:64"/>his counſellour, or who firſt gave unto him, and retribution ſhall be made: for out of him, and by him, and in him be all things, to him be glory unto endles ages. Amen.</p>
                  <p>And all that I have hitherto ſaid about our ignorance both of nature and providence is but in explication of our B. Saviours antecedent in his argument to Nicodemus: and to cloſe up my whole diſcours I finiſh all with his ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme: If you conceiv not ſaith he terreſtrial things when they are ſpoken, or propounded to you, how can you think of your ſelves to comprehend celeſtial: and ſo ſay I.</p>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:121335:64"/>but real ſcience where is it? what do we yet truly and certainly know of the many things God hath made or done amongſt us? Even ſo little, and in ſo ſmall a manner that without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence we may call it nothing: And ſo muſt every one acknowledg, except he will pretend himſelf to be wiſer than Salomon. And the buſineſs of religion muſt needs concern either God in his own nature and properties, or his works, or providence; in all which things we are of our ſelves equally ignorant, as well he that advances his way with paſſion, as he that defends himſelf; as well the opponent as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent; and the advantage, if any there be, is preciſely on his ſide that exceeds in humility and reſigns himſelf to ſome greater autority than any private mans can be.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefor be ſure we are in the right, before we whet our indignation about it againſt our innocent neighbour: and ſince we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find that out of our ſelves, let us never ſtrive againſt him with paſſion, but either diſcours with a ſweet charity and moderation, or els leav him altogether as he is in his own thoughts, which for aught I can know of my ſelf may be true and good; his reaſons tho not to me yet to an indifferent arbiter may be equally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive with mine own, and perhaps more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious, and on both ſides but topical places at the beſt, if both opinions be perſonal and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:121335:65"/>ſtand alone ſeparated from all autority extrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, whence they ſhould receive a further and more prevailing power: for no demonſtration or uncontroulable ſcience is to be expected in this world by ſuch poor worms as we, about ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God or his works or conſtitutions: and whatſoever is ſaid, be it aſſerted never ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily, may by the ſame or ſemblable grounds be as ſtoutly contradicted. What then can we do better or more conſonant to the darknes of our preſent condition, than to have peace with all men, to judg none, to ſuſpect our ſelves and commend the innocent intention both of our ſelves and others, unto that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty goodnes, who having placed us in this world of darknes will expect no more from us than lies within our reach and power; and if any thing be ſuch 'tis a rational reſignation and quietnes.</p>
                  <p>As ſeveral opinions have been advanced and maintained in the world, maugre all oppoſition of word or pen, without any the leaſt totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or fear of yielding on the defendents ſide, ſo am I aſſured that any whatever opinion ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther old or new and hitherto unheard of, may be defended againſt the reaſon of all mankind joined together againſt it, if but reſolution and contempt of the opponent go along as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally it does with him that is reſpondent and defender of it; whether he guide himſelf
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:121335:65"/>by reaſon, authority or other light: if he go by the firſt, no reaſon but his own ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted for reaſon; if by the ſecond, his own autority ſhall be caſt in to counterballance to any autority brought againſt him, and his own be it what it will ſhall be of force, all others againſt him either not genuine, or impertinent or corrupted; if by the third, what ſhould any one go about to talk with him that will be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by nothing but a light which is onely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf; who as ſoon as he is oppoſed pitties the ignorance and darknes of his antagoniſt; for ſuch he peremptorily concludes all men to be, that gainſay his judgment which only he deems light. And well then may any one defend any thing when nothing can convincingly be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt him; either through the inevidence of the matter, or ſelf-conceit and obſtinacy of the authour. In the interim every opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns and is contemned; and in that ſtate will it remain, till long time and that mutability which laies hold on all things make it to expire, if there be not ſom ſpeaking oracle unto which both parties will ſubmit.</p>
                  <p>I need not for proof of this invincible perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy appeal unto the antient Philoſophers, none of whom could ever be brought to yield unto the others, though they were all great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of reaſon. Our preſent controverſies in England, which proceed for the moſt part upon
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:121335:66"/>autority, and yet by no autority will be laid down, may ſufficiently juſtifie my words. And all this happens by the unnaturall coupling together of darknes and paſſion, little knowing ignorance and all preſuming pride, ſelf-conceit and folly, which though they be as diſſonantly put together as the ox and aſs in a plow team, yet are they, ſo unhappy is our condition, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never aſunder.</p>
                  <p>Indeed he that is truly learned in theologicall affairs, who hath read all hiſtories greek and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin that may concern Chriſtianity from its firſt beginning to this day, peruſed the councels tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly, well underſtood the ancient fathers, maiſtered the ſubtile ſchoolmen, and ſo pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated all the books of the Bible that he is able to reſolve logically every treatis and diſcours thereof into its final ſcope: ſuch a man may haply diſcern, where the truth lies in a diſpute between two ſects or men grounded only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tradition or autority, if it be in one or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in neither of them, although for default of learning or exceſs of paſſion they may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them diſcern it. But yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if he, even that knowing perſon ſhall let his mind walk on yet further, and call that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry autority to account, as in natural reaſon well he may; how it came hither, where it reſided in every age ſince its firſt being, who firſt autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed it, and what ſufficient ground he could
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:121335:66"/>have ſo to do, what marks it may exhibite that it is indeed the off-ſpring of ſuch a father un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe name it goes, or that he erred not whoever he was in that particular who either firſt wrote or afterwards tranſcribed it, (and the tranſcribers may have been ſome thouſands of indifferent affections and capacities) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nothing in reaſon or other autority may gainſay it; whether the words in the original character by ſome art or other, (whereof there be tricks good ſtore) may not ſpeak another meaning, or at leaſt by ſome trope or ſcheme of rhetorick be otherwaies interpreted, &amp;c. then I ſay even that knowing perſon ſhall find himſelf in a miſt, and ſo thick a one too, as that except he rely upon the autority of ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving oracle, whom in theſe and whatever ſuch like things without further queſtion or doubt he may beleev, he ſhall never be able to get out of it. Eſpecially if he dive yet further into the ſecrets of providence concerning ſuch things; and queſtion firſt how divine goodnes ſhould permit the world to wander in darkneſs and in the errour of their waies, ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years without that truth ſo neceſſary as it is reported unto mans ſalvation; how a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ignorant men who are ordinarily tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with their own fanſies as oraculous viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould be choſen to be our maiſters in it: how theſe ſhould be ſo particularly inſpired,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:121335:67"/>and never any ſince them though of the ſame profeſſion; nor yet they till their maiſter was departed, if ever they did preſume or give out any ſuch thing, for in their writings we do not find they did; one indeed ſaies of the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that they were inſpired, but ſpeaks not any ſuch thing either of himſelf or coevange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts; and although the maiſter promiſed after his departure to ſend them his Spirit to teach them in his place all things they were to know, yet does it not thence follow that they wrote no more nor otherwaies than they ſhould; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many appearing contradictions and other humane infirmities that ſeem ever and anon to occurr unto a critick judgment, as well in their writings as other mens, might eaſily move one to think that thoſe illiterate men might as well fail in ſomthing, as all holy fathers greek and latin, and Senatours of all ſacred Councells ſince Chriſts time, profeſſours of the ſame Chriſtianity and pretenders to the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit have in ſome mens opinions erred and failed in many, namely all things wherein we finde them to gainſay us. And indeed we do in effect deal little otherwiſe with the apoſtles writings, when we give a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory interpretation to ſuch places as gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay our opinions, quite contrary to the expreſs words and the natural ſens they be apt to make out unto us, according to which all antiquity
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:121335:67"/>underſtood them, adjoyning withal our own natural reaſons why the text cannot otherwayes be true, but only in ſom trope or figur though we cannot our ſelves tell what; for example the places in goſpel that plainly ſpeak forth the the real preſence of Chriſts body in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt; which is no other but to ſay plainly thus much: If that writer let him be Evangeliſt or what he will really meant as he ſpake in his ſtory, he is not to be beleeved againſt the plain expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience both of our eyes touch and taſt, and ſo many improbabilities if not impoſſibilities of reaſon; and Chriſt himſelf either ſpake not in that manner the Evangeliſt uſes, or if he did he could not intend to affirm that which neither he nor God himſelf can make good. Nor will we grant any thing to Chriſt but what we can do our ſelves or underſtand at leaſt how it may be don. If there were upon earth any ſpeaking oracle unto whom all parties would ſubmit in theſe affairs, diſputes would ſoon end; if ſuch a one be excluded or denied, the very riſing of them is as ominous as the blazing of a comet or coming of a whale into a river and portends great diſturbance and deſolation. The world had that fearful apprehenſion, when they firſt beard that Luther would ſhine with his own light and defy the ſtars of heaven: But they were more than aſſured of much approaching miſchief when they once underſtood that Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:121335:68"/>had left the Roman Sea to ſhow himſelf and domineer and ſport in the freſh waters of Geneva.</p>

There can no other way, whereby any ſhould now afreſh, after Chriſtian religion has been above ſixteen hundred years profeſt in the world, ſet up himſelf a new extraordinary directour, be thought of or imagined; but either ſom high inconfutable reaſon, internal ſpecial light, or purer interpretation of formerly received Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture?

                  <p>Reaſon carries the faireſt ſhow, and ſeems moſt civil and manly; and if it lean upon prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of faith formerly received, it may do much good for the ſtrengthning or ſecuring of religion in weak beleevers; but then it makes not ſaith but ſuppoſes it, and muſt know with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,

Did religion com at firſt by reaſon? or muſt it only begin now? A good beleever can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think, that Chriſt the great maiſter had a reaſon for what he taught; but he muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve firſt, before he can think ſo. and altho he had a reaſon himſelf, yet ſince he taught us none, we can have from him no other reaſon but his autority, and this may be beleeved but not evidently proved: for his miracles record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and not ſeen, are as pure an object of faith as his autority and perſon: nay if I had ſeen them I could not have told my ſelf unto whom the intricacies of whole nature are ſo much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, whether nature and art might compas them or no; and ſo might I conclude him to be ſome ingenious perſon or great naturalliſt, but not a god. Nor is it likely that Chriſt ever meant, that reaſon ſhould frame our religion, both becaus he conſtituted ſuch men to plant faith, as were not any maiſters of arts; and if reaſon had been the buſineſs it had been fitter to ſend them about the world to learn than to teach; as alſo becaus himſelf, though he did oftentimes with ſubtil and moſt rational argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations confute the Phariſees errours, yet
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:121335:69"/>did he never by any reaſon that I can remember eſtabliſh his own doctrin nor anſwer to any <hi>Quomodo</hi> though he was often put to it; but ſtill when the Jews demanded <hi>How</hi> can this or that be, <hi>How</hi> can man forgiv ſins, <hi>How</hi> can this man give us his fleſh to eat, he repeated again his own aſſertion and doctrin, and might perhaps confirm it by miracle but he proved it not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And it was very fitting, if ſo be he were ſuch a perſon as we beleev him to be, that he ſhould be taken upon his word, and not ſtand to give his vaſſails a reaſon of his will. If Chriſt our Lord had been no more than an ordinary wiſe legiſlatour, yet could he not rationally intend at once both the unity of his Church upon earth, and the guidance of all men in it onely by reaſon of their own; for my reaſon is not his, and may well prove contrary as well to it as that of my neighbours; whence will reſult together not onely not one religion, but alſo no religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whiles one neighbours reaſon differs from another, and perhaps both from Gods. Wherfore wiſe and holy Church hath in all ages both forbid her children to diſpute their principles of religion in the ſenſe they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them, and alſo refuſed to be tried before any Senate by the philoſophy of any pure man, to ſtand or fall by his axioms: This is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent not only by ancient writings of Chriſtian doctours, but by a fact of Emperour Julian,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:121335:69"/>who falling from Chriſtian religion, amongſt other oppreſſions he deprived Chriſtians of their ſchools of literature throughout the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire, telling them by way of jeer, that Chriſtians need not any learning unto whom this one word <hi>Credo</hi> is ſufficient. And indeed it is ſufficient for faith, and muſt needs be both the ſufficient and only means of conſerving a Church in uniformity: for religion muſt be ſomthing which may be common to all perſons that profeſs it, and equally proportioned to all capacities and conditions, and ſuch a thing is to <hi>Beleeve,</hi> but not to <hi>ratiocinate:</hi> all men both rich and poor, wiſe and unlearned, prince and peaſant, may equally beleev one and the ſame thing, and ſo hold it uniformly from time to time: but if that very thing were to be ſet up unto each one by his own proper reaſon, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds of beings in ſenſitiv or vegetative na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, even from the oak to the muſtard ſeed would not more differ, than that one judgment in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral men: have there not been fifty or three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore ſeveral interpretations of theſe few words, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> &amp;c. and almoſt a hundred opinions amongſt the maſters of reaſon about their <hi>ſummum bonum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if any ſay, that it is enough for ſom great maſter in theſe times by the ſtrength of his reaſon to rais a religion that is onely to be accepted; and others of weaker abilities may
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:121335:70"/>either take all that from him, or only follow and hold what themſelvs are able by their own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to reach: This cannot ſatisfie at all; for firſt if I muſt take a religion upon the credit of ſome great maſters reaſon, which my ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judg or comprehend, I had as good take it from the firſt maſter and beleev as I do, and not ſuffer another in theſe dayes to make himſelf lord over me, and lead me another way of his own: and he indeed that does ſo, does not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by this ſlight put himſelf into the place of Him who conveighes faith, but of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf who made it; for the ſenſe is the life and ſpirit of all words, and Chriſt then ſhould but only adminiſter matter for this great new riſing Sun to quicken: On the other ſide if I be not to follow anothers reaſon but my own, what variety would there be in the world about the ſame thing, not only betwixt man and man, but betwixt one man to day, and the ſelf ſame man to morrow; for the opinions which be totally from our ſelves we change continually upon the variety either of our own intrinſick diſpoſitions or caſual alterations from without; and in each ſeaven years reſolution we find a whole volum of new thoughts and judgments within us, contrary to former ones we had of the ſame things, diet, clothing, paſtimes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, nature, providence, books, and yet all muſt ever be true, for generally in all the ages
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:121335:70"/>of our life, we are equally obſtinate in that we ſet upon: ſo that whiles reaſon is licenſed to create a religion, not only all the religions which any particular man ſhall run through in his life time, but thoſe alſo what ever they be which whole kingdoms and nations ſhall at any time accept of, in a word, all the religions of the whole earth muſt needs be juſtified: And he can mean no leſs who would have that to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and only that which reaſon makes forth: Both heretick and catholick, both Jew and Chriſtian, pagan and Mahometan do all and every one ſtifly defend, that his religion is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, that his beſt reaſon is with it and for it, and that no right reaſon can be againſt it?</p>
                  <p>If reaſon that ſhould follow, once go before and lead religion it will ſodainly thruſt Chriſt out of his chair, and ſeparate at once all his Church from him: For if I hold nothing but what reaſon dictates, then is not Chriſt my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; nor will there be any Church that may any more belong to Chriſt than to Democritus, Ariſtotle, or at leaſt dame Nature. If any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that we muſt take the words from Chriſt and his goſpel, but the proper ſenſe which words of themſelves cannot carry with them our own reaſon muſt make out. This indeed is true thus far, that as we do underſtand langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and human words, ſo are we accordingly to conceiv of their meaning, as we know thoſe
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:121335:71"/>words were either at firſt impoſed, or by long uſe have got the power to make out: and if thoſe words ſpeak faith, the ſame Church gives both words and ſens together, expounding them by her very practis which we daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers withal: but if any will further by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens of reaſon give power to any or all men, to make out at his pleaſur a particular ſenſe of his own, differing from the ancient meaning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed together with thoſe words, this muſt needs juſtifie Calvins private interpretation, from which this new doctrin differs but in words, whiles that is here called reaſon which he calls ſpirit, and both do equally exclude the guidance of any Church beſides the temple of their own heads, in both wayes every one is in deed and reality chief byſhop to himſelf; and equally will religion be as various and mutable as our thoughts, and anſwerable to the natur either of our reaſon or ſpirit, here wide, there narrow, there none at all. Nay what is there in chriſtianity that one reaſon or other as well as peculiarity of ſpirit may not deprave and fruſtrate; the goſpel may be made to ſpeak Mahometiſme with one reaſon &amp; the Alcoran to Evangeliſe by another.</p>
                  <p>S. Paul had no doubt a very ſublime intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and yet he declares that his own and every underſtanding in the world is to be captivated unto the obedience of Chriſt and his faith, and that all Chriſtians walk by faith and not by <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:121335:71"/>or evidence; which is a quite contrary way to this, that would have no religion but what coms from reaſon: According to this, all are to walk by ſight and not by faith; but in St. Pauls judgment all Chriſtians are to walk by faith and not by ſight: this would have faith captivated to the obedience of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, St. Paul would have the underſtanding cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated to the obedience of faith: And good reaſon it ſhould be ſo; for are not moſt part of the things our Lord revealed contingent and hid from our eyes? And if there can be made no demonſtration in nature of the things we do ſee and touch and convers withall, as is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently inſinuated, how can things inviſible be reached and confined and concluded by reaſon; and this indeed is the very ratiocination of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> Chriſt to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> whoſe word I ſhould beleev, although I did not my ſelf know either the antecedent to be true, or the inference cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and neceſſary. In my mind it is a poor ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination to think, that doctrinal words deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beleeved and practiſed in the world for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt two thouſand years, ſhould now at length be to receiv their true ſens from a new doctour in our times which hitherto the whole Chriſtian world wanted, and through the univerſall igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of mankind could not till now finde it out: and to adde for further countenance of the way, that the Church hath three times,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:121335:72"/>('tis pitty ſhe is not allowed her <hi>quatuor tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>) in the firſt ſhe walked by <hi>credulity,</hi> in the ſecond by <hi>probability,</hi> and in the third which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in theſe daies of ours by ſcientifical <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,</hi> is as weak a fanſy as the other: for one and the ſame Church muſt have the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and grounds and practiſe and articles of religion, which muſt needs be all of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively divers, if that were true? The ſame concluſions and articles can never iſſue from a dark credulity, a purblind probability, and a ſtaring demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>I know that in the ſecond and all ages of the Church preachers and doctours explicated and declared their faith by congruous ſimilitudes and reaſons, but neither then nor in any time of Chriſtianity, did they frame their faith either by reaſon or probability, nor yet allowed it either to ſtand or fall by thoſe means. St. <hi>Auſtin, Euſebius</hi> and St. <hi>Bernard</hi> lived in that which is by our new <hi>Rationaliſts</hi> called the age of probability; and yet the firſt in his book <hi>de utilitate credendi</hi> confutes the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees for ſaying that faith is not to be admitted till a clear reaſon of every thing be given, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> in the fifth book of his hiſtory condemns the <hi>Arthemonites</hi> for ſtraitning faith within the limits of human wit, St. <hi>Bernard</hi> in his epiſtles confutes <hi>Abailard</hi> for the ſame fault: And they were all three backt with that great apoſtle
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:121335:72"/>who ſpeaks confidently that <hi>fides eſt rerum non apparentium,</hi> Heb. 11. And again by another, if not the ſame as great as he, who ſaid, <hi>we preach Chriſt crucified to the Jews a ſcandal, to the Gentiles folly, for the Jews ask a ſign, and the Gentiles require wiſdom,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. So that in St. Pauls divinity as 'tis Judaiſme not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev without a ſign, ſo likewiſe to ſuſpend our faith upon philoſophicall reaſon is pure paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme. I will not burden my paper with the teſtimonies of thoſe ancient heroes who profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly affirm that they all rely wholly upon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure faith, and not upon any reaſon either to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall or demonſtrative for their religion. St. <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſhall ſerv for all; <hi>Fides non habet meritum,</hi> ſaith the firſt in his homilies upon the Goſpel, <hi>ubi humana ratio praebet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentum,</hi> ſpeaking of human reaſon that ſhould precede faith: <hi>Theodoret</hi> in his <hi>graecani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis affectibus</hi> ſpeaks thus, <hi>Cur noſtrum creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis &amp; fidei titulum accuſatis? quodque noſtris ſententiis tradendis nullam demonſtrationem prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendamus, ſolam vero illis fidem at<expan>

                  <p>But this way of ſetting up and holding that only to be religion, which right reaſon will make forth and juſtifie, is a rare and untrodden path, and which ordinary ſpirits dare not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon; and 'tis held forth only by ſome wits here in London, I ſuppoſe to daſh out of countenance that groſſer way of maintaining all by Scriptures texts; and it will ſerv well enough for exerciſe and diſcours, when good wits meet together, as Cicero ſhowed his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in defending Paradoxes: but it muſt needs be dangerous, if it be once believed and reduced to practis: nor is it eaſie to ſay whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſolitary reaſon, or a text privately inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted would caus more and greater inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: this makes the skirts of the Church too narrow, that inlarges them too wide; even ſo wide, that all Jewes Turks and Pagans would by this reckoning be in the truth; which in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is onely to ſay, there is no religion at all; <hi>quod ubique eſt nuſquam eſt:</hi> and ſo much is eaſily collected by the generall axiom joined with our own particular experience to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for if nothing is to be beleeved but what can be demonſtrativly proved, and we find by experience that nothing can be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrativly proved either about Gods will, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence or nature, it will thence neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that nothing at all is to be believed: and he that holding the axiom endeavours withall
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:121335:73"/>himſelf to demonſtrate the whole body of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, creates the like concluſion in mens minds without further words, when they find he has demonſtrated nothing.</p>
                  <p>The power of reaſon then will not ſuffice to ſet up a new guide: and he that pretends this for his own preheminence before others, muſt either actually in words or at leaſt vertually in effect diſable the whole reaſon of mankind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his own; which to ſober men will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt his caus, but rather render him and all his reaſon contemptible.</p>
                  <p>Some will object; how can our faith then be rational, or how can we give a reaſon for our faith if indeed we have none for it. I anſwer, that faith has his reaſon, as ſcience hath his; and both be good reaſons but very much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: the reaſon of ſcience is drawn from the very intrinſick bowels of the truths that be known, but faith draws his reaſon from the autority of him who delivered it; this ſerves one and the ſame for the ſtability of all articles be they never ſo many and diverſe, as the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for example, and ſacraments, creation and the life to come; whereas every ſeveral conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in ſcience muſt have his own proper rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And one of theſe muſt not have, nor can it admit of the reaſon that is peculiar to the other, for then it ſhould not be it ſelf: if ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhould have an extrinſecal reaſon from au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:121335:74"/>it would then not be <hi>ſpecies</hi> but <hi>fides,</hi> not evidence but faith; and if faith ſhould have an intrinſical one, it would not be faith but evidence. He gives the beſt reaſon in the world for his faith, that reſolves it into an autority which is the beſt can be had: and he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves it into his own reaſon, as he cannot but run himſelf into danger, conſidering the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous frailty and darkneſs of mans judgment in all things; ſo likewiſe conſidering that the very eſſence and quiddity of faith requires to rely ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately upon the credit of a revealer, inſtead of defending faith he deſtroyes it. To beleev no more then we ſee is indeed to beleev no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>Let wiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord make up the concluding argument. <hi>Man</hi> ſaith Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon can <hi>find out nothing</hi> of the works which God hath wrought from the beginning to the end, nor of all the works of God almighty can he find out any reaſon, of the things that are done under the ſun, and the more he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to ſeek the leſs he finds, although the wiſe man, or philoſopher, ſhould ſay he knows them, he cannot do it. Thus ſpeaks <hi>Salomon,</hi> arming us aforehand againſt the temptations of any who might endeavour to miſlead us by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens of demonſtration into erroneous wayes to our own prejudice. Then comes <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord in his diſcours with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> wherein
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:121335:74"/>he teaches him the regenerating power of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme which <hi>Nicodemus</hi> could not underſtand and makes up the argument, to this effect; If you cannot comprehend even the things you ſee and feel and convers with here on earth, this is Salomons <hi>antecedent,</hi> as the wind for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which you do not know either whence it comes or whither it goes, much leſs muſt you expect to comprehend the inviſible and celeſtial ſecrets of religion, this is Chriſts <hi>conſequence;</hi> as if he had ſaid, theſe things are ſublime and forreign and brought to you, from another ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour place you know not, and therefor to be ſubmitted unto by faith, and not to be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with your poor reaſon, which does not ſo much as know the things that be at home. And it is an argument <hi>à minore ad majus.</hi>

                  <p>BY reaſon of this great obſcurity of things (whereby we are led into ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny petty differences where otherwiſe there would be none) we are ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from diving into weightier affairs, that not one of a thouſand does ſo much as think of them: ſo that greater things we take hand over head and boggle at leſſer, which in reaſon muſt needs follow upon the admittance of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. The caus of all this is, the narrow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of our judgments and conſiderations, which ſeldom look forth out of our own doors. And hence it is, that if any one by caſualty of birth, ſociety, books, or perſonal fanſy, adjoin himſelf once to any one opinion here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, he ſodainly entertains ſuch a prejudice againſt all the reſt, that there is left in him no further place for counſel: for all other wayes beſides his own are condemned, as ſoon as his own is accepted; and he does no ſooner think himſelf ſure, but all others muſt in the ſame
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:121335:75"/>time be loſt. And yet he hath but his own judgment for it neither, ſupported only with the appearances of I know not what ſpirit or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal light, which he and his enjoy and all others want. And if a man preſs him once to further difficulties than himſelf hath thought on, though without the reflection upon them he could never be able to ſettle any firm judgment about theſe things in particular, one ſhall ſoon find that he heeds not any of thoſe things, without which the other could not be judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly concluded; nor is able even by the help of that light or ſpirit of his, to ſatisfy therein either himſelf or other man: which argues plainly that the ſpirit and light he pretends is nothing but his own private reſolution not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently amplified, and yet irrationally fixed againſt all autority and counſel.</p>
                  <p>The Chriſtians in antient times eſpecially for the firſt four hundred years after Chriſt, had many ſerious and grave diſputes with the Jew and pagan; which being rational and weighty, and about the foundations of Chriſtianity whereon the other articles were built, did puſle even the wiſeſt of their clergy to anſwer: but after all the ratiocination ended, whether it ſufficed or no, they ſtill concluded with this one word <hi>Credo,</hi> which the love of Chriſt had faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon them; as emperour Julian comonly ſurnamed the Apoſtate teſtifies of them. And
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:121335:76"/>this, although in philoſophy and logick it had been a weak anſwer, yet in religion it was the beſt and only one to be made; ſo that all the burden fell at length upon the autority of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who being both a man, and one too that was crucified as a malefactor undertook to ſend forth religion into the world under the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of a divine Prophet, and the onely Son of God almighty maker of heaven and earth, which could not but at firſt make a diſturbance both among the Jewes and Gentiles where it ſhould be preached. And the great myſtery begins here, and here it muſt end; for this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority being once admitted from the Church that brings it, all other catholick truths will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low by a kind of conſequence from the ſame hands: and therefor this autority of his which can never be demonſtratively proved unto us that live now but only by vertue of the Church that derives it us, Chriſt muſt maintain himſelf by ſigns and wonders, and ſuch ſignall proofs of his divine providence over his Church from time to time, that his deity may ſomewhat ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his Churches progres and defence; and all other doctrins muſt be made good by it, and the Church that firſt preached it to us.</p>
                  <p>In any age of the Chriſtian Church a Jew might ſay thus to the Chriſtians then living: <q>Your Lord and maiſter was born a Jew, and under the juriſdiction of the high Prieſts;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:121335:76"/>theſe he oppoſed, and taught a religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Moſes, (otherwiſe how coms there to be a faction) but how could he juſtly do it? no human power is of force againſt Gods, who ſpake (as you alſo grant) by Moſes and the Prophets; and divine power it could not be, for God is not contrary to himſelf. And although your Lord might ſay, as indeed he did, that Moſes ſpake of him as of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to com greater than himſelf, yet who ſhall judg that ſuch a thing was meant of his perſon? for ſince that Prophet is neither ſpecified by his name or characteriſticall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties who could ſay it was he more than any other to come. And if there were a greater to com than Moſes were; ſurely born a Jew he would being com into the world, rather exalt that law to more ample glory, than diminiſh it. And if you will further conteſt that ſuch a Prophet was to abrogate the firſt law, and bring in a new one, who ſhall judge in this caſe? the whole Church of the Hebrews, who never dreamed of any ſuch thing, or one member thereof who was born a ſubject to their judgments.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the great oecumenicall difficulty: and he that in any age of Chriſtianity could either anſwer it, or find any bullwark to ſet againſt it, ſo that it ſhould do no harm, would eaſily ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſolv or prevent all other difficulties ſhould
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:121335:77"/>ariſe by the ſame autority by which it was cleared. For if Chriſt were not only a lawfull Teacher, but even one that was greater than Moſes as Chriſtians beleev him to be; and both the one and the other pretended this great work of eſtabliſhing a Church, ſurely Chriſt muſt do it in as great an excellency as Moſes and with ſome advantage; the doctrin and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplin muſt be as ſublime and ſtated as perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently as his: and Chriſt, who wrote no law, muſt ſo provide notwithſtanding, that his Church might otherwiſe have one from him and keep it as uniformly as the Hebrew Church did theirs. Wherefore as Moſes after he had done all things which belonged to himſelf to do, conſtituted Aaron and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours to be guides, rulers, overſeers, and judges of all Controverſies that might ariſe in the tribes about any points of their religion he had written them. So muſt St. <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſſours be inabled by ſome equall if not more ſpeciall means, ſith they alſo were conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Chriſt to govern his flock, to capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate all men to the obedience of Chriſts will: otherwiſe his Church could not go on ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly in all ages, which uniformity is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and indeed the very life and conſervation of a Church, as that of the Hebrewes did. Nor may any body prudently imagin that the Spirit of <hi>Jeſus</hi> in his Church, and all the members
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:121335:77"/>thereof cooperates in every one immediately unto truth; as it does to grace; for then why ſhould he conſtitute doctours and paſtours and biſhops over us, as the good apoſtle learnedly aſſerts in his epiſtle to the Epheſians: <hi>Ipſe de dit quoſdam quidem apoſtolos, quoſdam autem prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, alios vero Evangeliſtas, alios autem paſtores &amp; doctores, ad conſummationem ſanctorum, in opus miniſterij, in aedificationem corporis Chriſti. donec occurramus omnes in unitatem fidei &amp; ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitionem filii dei, in virum perfectum, in menſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram aetatis plenitudinis Chriſti; ut jam non ſimus parvuli fluctuantes; &amp; circumferamur omni vento doctrinae, in nequit â hominum, in aſtutia ad circumventionem erroris:</hi> Moſt excellent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical words; where we have firſt the doctrin; that <hi>paſtours are ſet over us</hi> in the Church to guide us: then the end of that conſtitution; which he declares firſt poſitively; then nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively: the poſitive end is a perfect unity of faith which by that means muſt vegetate and fructify and grow up in one body, even as Chriſts natural body under one ſpirit and head, united and compacted together, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceas even ſo long as that myſtick body laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon earth, <hi>in menſuram aetatis plenitudinis Chriſti,</hi> till it receiv its final conſummation: negatively, to prevent ſchiſmes and herefies, which might otherwiſe render the Church in her members both contemptuous and liable to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:121335:78"/>continual ruin, whiles every particular perſon left to himſelf would be carried up and down like children with puffes of novelty blowing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral wayes, by the cunning ſubtilty of men, pretending new light, ſpirits, reaſons, and ſuch like ſtratagems, in <hi>aſtutia</hi> in their knavery and pride of heart to bring people into a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of errour; all which inconveniences are avoided by following the guidance of the Church and the Paſtours therein appointed over us. A general ſpirit of truth in thoſe that are ſet over the flock keeps them together and ſafe; whereas particular lights in the ſheep that are to be ruled would divide them from their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour and from one another; and diviſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Nor could that great Jewiſh argument be any way warded or put by, but by recours to the Churches infallibility, which can be no other but what Chriſt gave her; and his own autority and truth revealed by this Church is the utmoſt foundation that ſupports the whole fabrick; nor can there be any thing further aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſupport it but God with whom it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved to be united: for as all material buildings and their connexion are beheld with the eye, but their foundation is not ſeen but is beleeved by the influence it hath in ſupporting the fabrick, which it ſelf is ultimately ſuſtained by the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: So may we diſcern ſome conſequences of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:121335:78"/>the points of religion upon a ſuppoſal of a great fundamental truth upon which they all depend as this is, that Chriſt is a true and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine teacher: but this cannot be ſeen or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained otherwiſe than by a pure belief yielded unto that Church that firſt taught him; and His truth ſuſtains all his doctrin, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal fabrick of the Church built upon him; and it can be grounded upon nothing but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the center of all ſubſiſtence and verity. This connexion of us to the apoſtles, of the apoſtles to Chriſt, and Chriſt to God St. Paul inſinuates when he ſaith to the Chriſtians of Corinth; <hi>Omnia veſtra ſunt, ſive Paulus ſive Apollo, ſive Kephas, vos autem Chriſti, Chriſtus autem Dei.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Chriſtians might indeed reply to the Jew and ſay; that Chriſt our Lord was a holy and ſacred perſon, divine, innocent, miraculous, and unblamable in his whole life and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that he came from heaven by the miſſion of his eternal father and his own great benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to plant upon earth an univerſal catholick Church amongſt all nations, which in the fulnes of time God was pleaſed to do, whereas Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes had confined his Church by Gods command, till that hour of general ſalvation was come, unto the one family of Abraham; and that he had received autority from God ſo to do, which not only his own evangeliſts but even Moſes and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:121335:79"/>the prophets ſufficiently atteſt, who all do ſo ſpeak forth the birth and life paſſion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of this our great Meſſias, and the glory of his Church amongſt the gentiles ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as himſelf promiſed and it hath now appeared to be; and that nothing but rancour and prejudice and the ſcandal of his humility and the Jews miſtake of the Meſſias his firſt and ſecond coming did incens them againſt their own lord when he appeared amongſt them; who alſo looked even then for a Meſſias ſodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to come whom they were to obey and follow; and cannot probably, being then the onely ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect people of God aſcribe their immenſe deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, exiles from their own homes, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries theſe ſixteen hundred years, than to the guilt they have contracted upon themſelvs by ſhedding the blood of that ſacred perſon. Nor are they to be excuſed, ſith all the ancient Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies before Chriſts coming did openly profeſs throughout all the Hebrew Church that they underſtood not the end and meaning of Moſes law nor ever ſhould, till the great Meſſias came to teach them, which was ſo beaten into their minds that all the Hebrewes beleeved it, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the ſaying of the woman of Samaria, <hi>When the Meſſias comes he will teach as all things:</hi> although through the hatred they bore to <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt they began after his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſing another ſong.</p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:121335:79"/>
                  <p>This I ſay and ſuch like words they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and prove all by ſome autority or other: but yet whatſoever they could alledge, the Jewiſh Rabbies would give another interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, or if it were their own goſpel flatly deny it; and ſo having no other further auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to rely upon but the truth of that Church that ſtands upon this foundation of Chriſts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, there they muſt reſt. For there can be no hope either of ſatisfying a querent or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convincing an opponent in any point of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity unles he will ſubmit to the ſplendour of Chriſts autority in his own perſon and the Church deſcended from him; which I take to be the reaſon, why ſom of the Jews in Rome, when S. Paul laboured ſo much to perſwade Chriſt out of Moſes and the prophets, beleeved in him and ſome did not.</p>
                  <p>So then, the great reſolv of all doubts muſt be immediately upon the autority of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church, which derived from the Church foregoing muſt by ſeveral concatenations bring us at length to the autority of Chriſt, which is the root and firmitude and life of all: and if this be once acknowledged and firm, and firm it cannot otherwaies be than by captivating our wills and underſtanding to his love and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience under that notion the Church hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed him; it muſt equally ſupport all future generations of Chriſtians be they never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:121335:80"/>in any temptation or difficulty that ſhould afterwards happen, and the whole Church and all her doctrin built upon it. Nor can any at any time pretend rightfully and juſtly other motive of his beleef, than what the apoſtles had for theirs; the firſt age from the apoſtles; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond age from the firſt, &amp;c. and ſtill the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Church does but derive the faith and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe received unto its ſucceſſour, and both muſt equally ſtand upon the ſame foundation of one and the ſame autority, which all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons take by the like reſignation and faith-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion unto the worlds end. So that he that departs in any age from the waies of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Church, upon what pretence ſoever it be done, of knowledge, interiour light, reaſon, ſpirit or other diſcovery, he leavs the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on which his faith was built and vertually forſakes Chriſt, and would have had the ſame argument againſt him, if he had lived in his time: for if the Church, the viſible Church prove not to be even in that particular age a juſt keeper and deliverer of faith received, then was the Church deceived not ſo much in that age as in the firſt, when ſhe took her faith from him that did manifeſtly ſo comport himſelf as if he would be taken for a God, and promiſed his Church by the general ſpirit he would ſend her, to teach her all truth and ſtrengthen her therein againſt all oppoſition even to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:121335:80"/>of the world: which none but God or one exceeding near unto him could make good: and if this were not performed, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture was in the firſt beginning. That build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt needs ſtand firm that reſts upon a Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which hath influence upon the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick to keep it up; and if it be not ſo kept up and conſerved, the Church doth but vainly flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her ſelf when ſhe boaſts of the divinity of her ſupport; if ſhe fail in her doctrin and faith, Chriſt is not God.</p>
                  <p>Whenſoever therfor we read either in the Acts of the apoſtles, or other ancient ſtory of the converſion of a Kingdom or people unto the right religion of Chriſtianity, we ſtill find it was done not by any private illumination of any one, who living before in darknes with the reſt was now ſecretly called to teach others; but by a reſignation unto a former do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin brought from Chriſt by his miſſioners and preachers; by ſubmiſſion to a truth delivered to them from without, not riſing up within them. Faith comes by hearing; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man upon earth, that hath ever been appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Chriſtian received it that way, and was made thereby not a maiſter but diſciple to the Church. Wheras on the other ſide this ſpirit and light and ſuch like diſcoveries we ſo frequently talk of, makes us not ſchollers but maiſters <hi>ipſo facto;</hi> and urges not to ſubmit to foregoers but
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:121335:81"/>to condemn them; not to reſign our own but to captivate others underſtandings, not to go to the Church, but to go out of it; and that upon the ſingle motive of a new illumination which none had before us, and we from no body.</p>
                  <p>I know well enough that a man cannot be converted and becom a good Chriſtian without the aſſiſtance of Gods grace exciting and coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating with us to our good, when the truth is taught and revealed to us: But this I ſuppoſe is not the Light men talk of; for this is rather in the affection and will than in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bids us hearken to another not to our ſelves; to join with a Church already planted, not to begin a new one of our own heads: It ſayes not to us make a vineyard of your own, but go into mine. And the intellectuall Light men ſpeak of, if we have any we receiv it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as a reward of our humility in that Church, where we did not kindle it but found it already burning, to guide our feet by it in the wayes of peace; <hi>Crede &amp; intelliges</hi> ſaid a great Prophet, Beleev and you ſhall underſtand: but we muſt beleev firſt, and by that obſcure ſtep of beleef, which is as a duksy twi-light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the darknes of infidelity we lived in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and the light of truth we go to, arrive we to all future happines.</p>
                  <p>But we in England that pretend this new
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:121335:81"/>Light and ſecret Spirit, are ſeparated by it from a former Church but brought to none; nor are we made diſciples by it but maiſters on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and enabled to teach all men that which we never received from any: which is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the whole cours of Chriſtianity, and will if it be admitted ſet open a gap unto all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick fanſies.</p>
                  <p>St. Paul profeſſes he was apoſtle not of men nor by men but by God; and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus his firſt call was extraordinary from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as was likewiſe the ſuggeſtion he had to his miſſion; and yet that God that called him, although he ſhowed him ſo ſingular a favour, yet would he not diſpenſe with his own orders and conſtitutions even in him, but ſent him to the good Prieſt Ananias to be by him inſtructed and catechiſed and admitted into his Church; and with thoſe people St. <hi>Paul</hi> found in the profeſſion of that faith did he often conferre, even he that was ſo ſtrangly called from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven conferred the Goſpel which afterwards he preached, as himſelf ſpeaks in his epiſtle to the Galatians, with thoſe people and with that Church he found in actuall poſſeſſion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of that faith, <hi>leaſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I ſhould have run in vain;</hi> that is leaſt he ſhould do or think or preach any thing amiſs contrary to the truth received unto which he was called; which he could no otherwaies by the conſtitutions Jeſus
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:121335:82"/>himſelf had made be aſſured of, but by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring his doctrin with that which was believed and practiſed in the Church before him; into which he was now incorporated as a member in that body by the aſſiſtance of the grace he had received, to be firſt a diſciple and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a maiſter and teacher; and when he did become a doctour, he did not make himſelf one, no nor his calling by Chriſt ſufficed to do it, but he was made ſuch a one under the hands of the apoſtles, and by their approbation, autority and ſacred ordination, as may be ſeen in the book of the Acts ch. 13. Nor was he to teach without that Churches leav or contrary to her faith, but by her direction and in ſubjection to her.</p>
                  <p>This is a faithful ſpeech and worthy of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which ſeriouſly pondered would diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate in a moment all whatſoever pretences of light, ſpirit, reaſon, or other thing that ſhall mov any to a new way by himſelf, contrary to what he hath received &amp; ſeen practiſed in the Church before him. And if any would ſeriouſly peruſe the Acts of the apoſtles, wherein the footſteps of primitive Chriſtianity fufficiently appear, he ſhall find that all that were called unto Chriſts religion, were brought to the feet of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and prieſts who received them at the door, and brought them into the hous of God by the laver of Baptiſme, and impoſition of hands and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:121335:82"/>confeſſion of ſins, and it was not onely the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary but ſole ingreſs into that Church; and none were ever eſteemed to be of that body but only by thoſe means, which alſo the paſtours of the Church were only to mannage. He that comes not in at the door, ſaith Chriſt, is neither ſheep nor ſhepheard but a theef and a robber. And true Chriſtian religion conſiſts not in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a Church but coming in, there to ſubmit to the ancient dictates of piety which Chriſt revealed.</p>

                  <p>TO a judicious man whom a word ſufficeth it will already appear that no opinion or way here in England can have any advantage over the other, by vertue of diſcoveries made by any light, ſpirit or reaſon: ſince there can no ſuch be legally pretended to ſet up any new reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion apart from the former, but to join rather with the old, which if it be not abſolutely true, Chriſt is not God, and all Chriſtianity but a human invention.

                  <p>The Quaker (for I have both read their books and converſed frequently with their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons)
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:121335:83"/>is in appearance very juſt and honeſt, his open pretenſes good and plauſible, and books ſpiritual enough to one of our vulgar readers, unto whoſe judgment they be well proportioned; for good words are put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to promote ſolid and ſincere honeſty, and to evacuate that empty ſhow of piety which has now generally taken place in the world in lieu of the real ſubſtance that is in a manner quite vaniſhed out of our hearts and hands: But theſe words are ſo ſtrangly jumbled together, that every line has good ſens in it, but all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther none; for as they carry no reference to any one ſupreme ſcope, to which as the utmoſt object of the whole diſcours all thoſe phraſes may be applied; ſo being well examined and compared together they will be found very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to gainſay one another; and he that looks for connexion and correſpondence either of ſens or ſentence, will loſe his labour. I have never ſeen any thing, that for the ſtile and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of the ſpeech doth more nearly reſemble <hi>Mahomets</hi> Alcoran than a good Quakers book; for in both be handſom words, ſom dreaming conceits interlarded with undeniable truths, much imperious cenſur of all mankind that will not ſubmit to that way, endles tautologies, and no connexion; and it would even amaze a man to ſee how pathetically the good <hi>Quaker</hi> decries all mortal men and tramples them under his

                  <p>Well good neighbour, it is enough: When Chriſt comes we will worſhip him, and beg to be admitted into his kingdom; till then let us have peace, which is I am ſure ſome part of it. We cannot anſwer you, if that will ſatisfy you whom I know no anſwer will. Every good
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:121335:85"/>man in the world wiſhes with you that all iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were done away; and well may you I ſhould think content your ſelves with them to wiſh it ſo to all, and ſee it done in your own perſons Why do you trouble the world with your uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les clamours, and put it ſo out of tune, that Chriſt when he coms can find no quiet entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the land, for the wars and broils his great Saints have made in it? If you talk a little longer of Chriſts coming, and make way for him as the fanaticks did laſt January with bright ſteel armour and ſhining head pieces, ſharp cimiters, piſtols and harquebuſſes, ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fighting and ſeverely declaring againſt the whole earth whom they condemned to ruin, we have reaſon to fear that the ſirname of this your Chriſt will be <hi>Oliver,</hi> and your golden dayes but the ſlaughter and bloudſhed of your innocent neighbours. If your meaning be good, ſhow it by your peaceable converſation; and ſpeak no more to us, for we need it not and heed it as little, but ſay your prayers in your cloſets, and prepare your ſelves for his coming, whom you judge ſo near: Nothing is ſo ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious as tumultuous piety. And I do earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requeſt you would ſeriouſly peruſe two ſhort ſtories related by wiſe <hi>Gamaliel</hi> in the fifth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of the Acts, and make them a part of your primmer. <hi>Men Iſraelites,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>look to theſe men what you are to do. Before theſe dayes there
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:121335:85"/>was one Theodas profeſſing himſelf to be ſome body unto whom conſented a number of men about four hundred, who was ſlain and all that beleeved him was diſſipated and brought to nothing. After him there was Judas Galileus in the dayes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and he drew people after him; and he periſhed himſelf, and ſo many as conſented to him were diſperſt.</hi> And both theſe roſe up under a pretens of piety; and, if I be not miſtaken, for Chriſt too; whoſe reign they would have ſet up in Paleſtine before his firſt coming, or thereabouts, even as you would now before his ſecond, to the diſturbance of the kingdom you live in.</p>
                  <p>So then, good friends, ſetting aſide your vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent exclamations againſt all that adhere not to you, which you cannot your ſelves juſtify, for humility and peace is the great and inſeparable property of piety if it be true and real, our agreement with you is already made: for the true light you magnify we praiſe it too and hope we enjoy it; the vice you deplore we do equally deteſt; the coming and reign of Chriſt we hope and wiſh for with all Chriſtian reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the two horns of miniſtery and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, as ſoon as the world is grown ſo good and peaceable as there ſhall be no further uſe of them, will be taken away; but till all iniquity and the wild beaſts you ſpeak of be rid out of the earth, I hope you will be ſo rational as not

                  <p>The Anabaptiſt walks with the Quaker and makes up with him a pair of Independents; his books carry the like pious ſtrain, but have ſomewhat a clearer colour of art and leſs of zeal. The particular controverſy of <hi>Infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſme,</hi> which becaus he allows not of it, gives him his ſpecial name, I will not meddle with. But his great argument why children ſhould not be baptiſed, namely becaus they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not either know what is done to them or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr themſelvs to the effect, if it were of force, might in my mind equally hinder their corporal nurs to waſh or make them clean, unto which they are ſo far from concurring that as much as they are able they reſiſt it and ſtruggle and kick and cry amain when 'tis done, not knowing what good is done to them; and as there is as much need of the ſpiritual waſhing as of that, ſo can God as eaſily with his laver make their ſouls clean without their help, as we their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.

We have all one Lord and Maiſter, and we equally his ſervants unto whom alone we either ſtand or fall, from whoſe fulnes we receiv all of us grace for grace. Did not the maiſter check his apoſtles for the like ſpirit-ambition, when they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured againſt the vein of the ingoings of humble Chriſt within their ſouls, to be one greater then another, whereas they were all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently under him whom they called Lord and maiſter, and by his own teſtimony very truly.

The firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Proteſtants in the ſulnes of time and age of reconciliation-light, whom both you and we acknowledg to be indued with moſt ample gifts and eſſences of Chriſt within the cloſets of their ſouls, ſtruggled and lift and bore up more reſolutely againſt this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall-government the very Egiptian reſidence whence ſucceeding darknes ſpred it ſelf about the world, than any one or other pernicious
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:121335:87"/>doctrin might have flowed from that ſours, unto the obſtructing of the light-diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from above. And not without reaſon, for all doctrin-vaſſailage was exerciſed and kept in hand by that Epiſcopacy-power over mens immortall ſouls, whoſe command be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to him who ſees and rules hearts, to the utter ruin of all Chriſtian liberty in the Goſpel-meſſengers who now were to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter to the hungry mouths of ſoul-ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved perſons not bread of life from heavenly places, but husks and chaft from the earthly pallaces of dry and deceitful dictates of men. Nor was this Prelate-preſidentſhip ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in any reformed Churches beyond the ſeas where reformation-light firſt ſprang forth, but pulled down and abhorred either as downright Popery or at leaſt the ſhadow and imitation of it: and we who be the lights of the world and ſalt of the whole earth, as we are to refrain from all ſhow of evil, ſo can we not find upon earth any ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or ſpirit-power by which we may be made good: for if the primary lights of the world and ſtars of the firmament be once put out, who ſhall lighten them again, whoſe abode is in earth and clay? And if the ſalt have loſt his ſavour wherewith ſhall it be ſeaſoned? Nor can we be ignorant that this Epiſcopacy-power was ſet up in England many years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:121335:88"/>Reformation-ingreſs by the ambitious po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of ſom men who falling from their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer humility-ſpirit ſet up that chair of a State-ſpirituall for themſelves, which when another ſate in it they uſed all kind of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour force and power to throw it down.</p>
                     <p>Can prelate-affecters deny that Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-power was by the firſt and pureſt reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-light utterly ſubverted? If you know it not, the ſmallnes of your judgment will comdemn you, if you know it and do the contrary you are condemned in your own judgment: and if the Reformation was impure in this, then was Proteſtant Reformation corrupt both in its firſt birth and the moſt glorious of all its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, wherein our conſciences were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the tyrant-yoaks of inveigling men unto the ſweet influences of Chriſt, who as he is the great paſtour of ſouls, ſo he is ſure not to miſlead his flock by any ſuch paſſions as do frequenty domineer in man, when he is once ſet over his fellow ſervants, pride, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſelf-will and intereſt. And if we be once brought again to the ſame ancient ſervil yoak of conſcience-tyranny to receive our light and influences from men as before we did under Popery, why may we not by the ſame ſtrong tide of an irreſiſtable ſelf-leading pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be driven uncontroulably to the ſame or greater errours? Except you will ſay, that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:121335:88"/>the Archbiſhop of Canterbury is a ſurer and more unerring guide than the Romiſh by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop: both of them I am ſure be men and equally fallible, who ſtanding either of them betwixt us and home may by their uſurped power over conſciences which be only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the inviſible Lord of truth lead us again either into our ancient or ſome new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented errour, and if they impoſe the yoak who can reſiſt them: But the Lord of truth cannot lye, and the beams of his light falling immediately upon his peace-meſſengers as once upon the apoſtles in cloven tongues of fire, untainted with the interpoſition of any intervening obſtacle muſt needs be both clear and true. <hi>I will teach you all things,</hi> ſaith he, to his apoſtles; he ſaid not that one of them ſhould teach another; nor did thoſe cloven tongues deſcend firſt from Chriſt upon Peter, from Peter to Andrew, from Andrew to John and ſo forward in an hierarchical line which Papiſts imagine in their Church, but from Chriſt alone immediately upon them all. Nor can you move us at all by telling us as you do of ancient tradition for Epiſcopacy-power even from Chriſt time unto this preſent age, ſith all thoſe times and places are concluded by the pious Reformation under popiſh dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which began even in Pauls time when the myſtery of iniquity, even this myſtery of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:121335:89"/>papall tiranny began to work, and ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed the whole earth, till at length the Lord was pleaſed by the fooliſhnes of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enlighten thoſe little ones who were predeſtined to beleev a truth aforetime hidden to all the ſons of men. Did we not all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from ſuch popiſh traditions to the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, to the goſpel, to the word of God, and to the truth that cannot lye: And what other inſtrument did we make uſe of, to the aboliſhing of that human ſupremacy over mens ſouls, which now again by erroneous tradition you would contrary to your own principles obtrude upon us, than that very word and oracle. And the goſpel which as it is now by Reformation-purity put into every mans hand, ſo is every man, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſucceſſors to the apoſtles by the help of Chriſts light which by frequent prayer they unite to themſelvs, the people by light they receiv from goſpel-miniſters to interpret and underſtand it, is totally with us and for us. Look into the goſpel of Matthew, &amp;c. <hi>Hic ſubauditur longus textuum catalogus ab initio ad finem Biblii contra epiſcopatum.</hi> If you reply that we muſt for the ſenſe of all theſe places have recours unto the Church; what Church do you mean, yours out of which you ſay we are fallen, or the popiſh Church which both you and we deſerted? Take which you
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:121335:89"/>will, for the ſame reaſons and goſpel-verities equally reject them both: and if we muſt hearken to your Church, out of which you ſay we are fallen, why then did not you obey that Church out of which you ſell your ſelves; if that were in errour, and therefore to be deſerted, yours is in no better condition: but the inviſible congregation of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, which in our firſt reformation we took to be the Church, can never fail. And if you begin now to take the Church in a popiſh ſenſe for any hierarchicall prelacy, you do at once condemn your ſelves both of inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and diſſimulation and alſo of violation of goſpell, and rebellion againſt that viſible Church our forefathers found themſelves in, unto which it ſeems now by this tenour of your ſpeech they were bound by their Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity to obey. Scripture autority you have none for you, nay it is all againſt you; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man words and practiſes being now rid by Chriſt of all thoſe ſervil yoaks we valiew not, and the true light of pureſt Reformation which you have deſerted ſith it is with us as at the beginning, we muſt not forfeit; nor do any thing may obſtruct the ingoings and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goings of little Chriſt within us.</p>

                  <p>Whiles the Presbyterian is hotly buſied in this his plea againſt the Prelate-Proteſtant, the Independent touches his elbow and adviſes him
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:121335:90"/>to bethink himſelf leaſt with the ſame weapon he wound his adverſary and kill himſelf. For if ſuch reaſonings, ſaith he, be of value, what will then becom of the clerical Presbyterian black coat, which being derived from popery, finds no more grounds in ſcripture than epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy hath. Are not all men equally ſubject to Chriſt, and capable alike of his divine influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? and ſo indeed it is ſaid of the times of Chriſtianity. <hi>And they ſhall be all taught of God.</hi> How then com other teachers to intrude betwixt us and God, to obſtruct and taint and variouſly infect his light; thoſe upon whom the Holy Ghoſt deſcended were all lay men, as we be, and ſom of them women too. But as ſoon as the Presbyterian turning upon him called him fanatick; the proteſtant cried, In neither barrel better herring, ye are both ſo. It was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly replied by them both, when did the ſpirit leav us to ſpeak unto you? by what light or ſcripture can you make that good, you that are blinded in your own errours.

The Roman catholick I do not here mention; for the taking <hi>Him</hi> for his guide and judg from whom he firſt received his ſcriptur and faith, and expecting all reſolutions of doubts only from his lips, can never ſtagger or fall into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity. But with Proteſtant Presbyterian and Independent, whoſe utmoſt reſolv is in their own hands, the caſe is otherwayes. And the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat that is amongſt them is the moſt deſperate imaginable; whiles any viſible ſpeaking judg being excluded by them all, each one fights againſt all the reſt with the ſame topick ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, that none but he that uſes them muſt judg, Scripture is for us, ſcripture is eaſy and we have it, the ſpirit that is in us teaches all truth, the light from above us is only to direct us, and not men who are lyers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And theſe if they prevail, overthrow him that uſes them; ſo that to the ſame combatant muſt needs happen by the ſame means both death and victory; and the ſame autorities and argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations if any of them obtain his deſire, muſt bear both a probility for him and a prejudice againſt him. Thus the Proteſtant, if he do or
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:121335:91"/>will pretend to convince the Presbyterian, then muſt he at the ſame time and for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons yield to the Roman catholick with whoſe diſcourſe and arguments he flouriſhes and triumphs againſt him; and yet being uttered from the mouths and pens of <hi>Catholicks</hi> againſt himſelf, he contemned and jeered them. And if the Presbyterian texts and reaſons be of force againſt the Proteſtant, then muſt the Proteſtant fall by that inſtrument by which himſelf ſtands and ſubſiſts againſt the <hi>Papiſt;</hi> againſt whom he hath ever uſed thoſe very aſſertions and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; and the Presbyterian too muſt ſtand and fall upon the ſame account, the ſame wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon laying him dead before the Independent which againſt the Proteſtant ſupports him. The Independent, if he be able by ſtrength of his light and ſpirit, to maintain himſelf againſt all his foregoers, Presbyterian, Proteſtant and Papiſt; then by the ſame reaſons muſt he needs fall when a new fanſy riſes by any ſucceding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
                  <p>A ſtrang caſe and indeed a meer riddle, but a certain truth. And the <hi>Catholick</hi> all this while to a diſintereſted underſtanding, whiles all his enemies condemn one another, ſtands uncontroulably juſtified in his oppoſitions to them. The <hi>Independent</hi> is in the wrong ſaith the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> erres, ſaith the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and <hi>Independent;</hi>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:121335:91"/>the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> is deceived, ſaith the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian;</hi> you are all mad men quoth the Roman <hi>Catholick,</hi> you firſt abuſed and ſupplanted me, and now by the ſame wayes and means you do ſupplant and abuſe one another. But if I may interpoſe my judgment, the Proteſtant, although I honour his gravity above all the reſt, ſeems to be in a wors caſe than either Presbyterian or Independent: for theſe in maintaining themſelvs and their wayes, do but ſtrike home the firſt principles of prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant reformation; whereas the Prelate-prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, to defend himſelf againſt them, is forced to make uſe of thoſe very principles which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf aforetime when he firſt conteſted againſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery deſtroyed; as be the difference betwixt <hi>clargy</hi> and <hi>laiety,</hi> the efficacy of epiſcopal <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi> the autority of a <hi>viſible Church</hi> unto whom all are to obey, and the like: ſo that upon him falls moſt heavily even like thunder and lightning from heaven, utterly to kill and cut him aſunder, that great oracle delivered by S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his letter he wrote to the Chriſtians of Galatia, <hi>Si<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quae deſtruxi iterum haec aedifico, praevaricatorem me conſtituo.</hi> If I build up again the things I formerly deſtroyed, I make my ſelf a prevaricatour, an impoſtour, a reprobate. A heavy ſentence. But truth will out, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will be juſtified at long running even by her greateſt adverſaries. It ſeems that thoſe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:121335:92"/>pieces of popery we ſo deſperately inveighed againſt for our own intereſt, were indeed not evil but good.</p>
                  <p>The Proteſtant may indeed with ſome plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſhow excuſe himſelf; and ſay, that the firſt <hi>Reformers</hi> though ſent from God, yet might they notwithſtanding have ſome little mixture of humane paſſion and infirmity, and ſo out do their work, and decry more then in truth they ought to have don; as he that would ſtraighten a crooked wand, bends it as much the other way, to the end that by that over force it may at length recover its mediocrity and ſtraightnes: and what ever is done amiſs by earneſtnes of paſſion, may by a ſecond thought be mended. And this excuſe would find place in any buſines of humane concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but whether it may be of any weight in affairs of religion and divine faith I leav others to judg; for what may be pretended by all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to endles changes, can never be rightly ſaid by any: and S. <hi>Paul</hi> having aſſigned that proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as a ſignal mark of a <hi>prevaricatour,</hi> I ſhould think we may beleeve it without further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>
                  <p>However by the reaſſuming of this epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, be it the ſubſtance or ſhadow of <hi>Popery</hi> or what you pleas, our Engliſh Proteſtant Church became by that means the very beſt and choiſeſt flower of all the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:121335:92"/>no order, no decency, no peace, no uniformity in all the world where Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy was received, like unto that we here enjoyed under our biſhops in England: nor could any man by the force of nature ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any the leaſt rottennes in the foundation of ſuch a handſom fabrick; I am ſure I had not, but by a ſtrang chance that happened to me in my childhood.</p>
                  <p>And although our Prelate-Proteſtant is not able to anſwer the Presbyterian objection, ſtanding upon his own firſt principles of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which do indeed and ever will juſtify all revolts to the worlds end; yet by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of his Recovery, thoſe I mean by which he reaſſumed Epiſcopacy too precipitouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried by the firſt reformers, which principles be firm and good and right Chriſtianity he will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily fruſtrate and diſſolv all oppoſition; but then he muſt creep into the boſom of Roman catholicks and beg the aſſiſtance of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which before he fooliſhly contemned. For every Body be it what it will, natural, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick or ſpiritual muſt ſo long as it remains en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and ſound, have the ſame principal parts and organs it was born withal, and cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure long even in a contrary poſture of them without diſſolution and ruin. Take any kingdom that is ſettled in monarchy, and if you endeavour once the ſubverſion of that Polity,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:121335:93"/>you do at the ſame time take away the life of all her laws and rights, and utterly diſturb her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines and peace, which are ſo mixed and intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in the very nerves and ſinews of her laws, and theſe again ſo ſettled upon the polity, as upon the prime innate influent Calid and radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call primogeneal Humid, that all goes together, and take part alike either in weal or woe. This truth we have had a ſad experience of in the time of our late civil warres, wherein our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy once ſubverted we all periſhed with it, and our rights and welfare at ſuch a loſs, that no man could ſay that aught he had remaining was his own. It muſt needs be ſo; for the government what ever it be, is before the laws; and the laws receiv all their ſtrength and vigour from the acknowledged autority of that power from whence they are derived.</p>
                  <p>Now that the Chriſtian Church was firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall under one Sovereign Byſhop, when Chriſt who founded it was upon earth, no man will deny; for ariſtocracy or democracy it could not be, ſith all his twelve apoſtles were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him as his diſciples, and not fellow do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours or legiſlatours with him: nor did he ever pretend to receiv his autority from men but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from God above, unto whom he was perſonally united; and this autority of his muſt firſt be accepted before his word can be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or his law acknowledged: and theſe muſt
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:121335:93"/>have all their force from that power which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its firmitude of truth gives them all their life and vigour, which remains and dies with it and with the government under which the laws and doctrin began. It appears then that all the laws and rules and promiſes and whole doctrin of Chriſtianity and founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſpiritual monarchy of Jeſus who was <hi>Man-God;</hi> that he might be both unto human kind a fit and proportioned head as <hi>man;</hi> and uncontroulable, independent, and infallible as <hi>God.</hi> And hence it muſt needs follow, that the ſubverſion of epiſcopacy which is the ſpirituall monarchy in which our Lord founded his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity muſt needs weaken and by degrees ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroy all faith; for the ruin of the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the death of all its laws founded in it.</p>
                  <p>Nor will it ſuffice, if an Independent or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian ſay, that they are ſtill under their head <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who being in heaven hath his ſpirituall influences over them. I ſay this ſuffices not: for the true Church of Chriſt wherſoever it is, muſt have the very ſame head ſhe had at firſt, or elſe ſhe cannot be the ſame body, and that head was man-God perſonally preſent in both his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with the body of his Church here on earth; and although Chriſt may and does ſupply the inviſible part of his God-head influence upon his myſtick body, yet a viſible head or byſhop if the Church hath not now over her, as at firſt ſhe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:121335:94"/>had, ſhe is not the ſame ſhe was, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the way to ruin. What then, you will ſay, cannot God preſerv his Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of man? I anſwer we muſt not here diſpute what God can do, but what he will do. God can warm the earth and make fruits to grow and us to ſee without the ſun; but if he have otherwiſe ordained we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect thoſe effects from the caus he hath ſet and no other wayes. And that all truths are to be expected from his Church, and from him he hath ſubſtituted in his place to govern us as our only viſible Paſtour, is manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent both by his own law and practiſe and our experience: By his law, when he ſayes, that he who will not hear his Church muſt be as a publican and reprobate; by his practiſe, when he would not have his own ſupernatural vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and endowment and light from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſuffice St. <hi>Paul</hi> either to make him a Chriſtian, or a Teacher, till he had received both from the hands of his Church and paſtors; by our experience, while we ſee from age to age, that all thoſe that withdraw themſelves from the Catholick Church and from her chief Byſhop and paſtour, let the occaſion be what it will or never ſo little, do run themſelves reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly into endles ſchiſms, denying one thing after another, ſtill from leſs to more, till at length all Chriſtianity be cancelled; and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:121335:94"/>with ſchiſme they end with atheiſme; all truth unity and peace being to be had onely from and in that one Church, which as St. <hi>Paul</hi> does well and wiſely call it Chriſts Body, ſo is it only animated with his ſpirit of truth, and from the government there appointed which is epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal, and in a ſpecial manner from the chief paſtour there preſiding ruling and directing in place of Jeſus Chriſt, unto whom all obey in yielding obeyſance unto him in ſpiritual affairs, according to his own order and appointment. Nor is there any more certain rule of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the approaching ruin of Chriſtianity in any perſon or people, than when we ſee them either ſecretly to undermine or openly to oppugn pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal autority. No pope no byſhop, no byſhop no Church, no Church no ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>This being once well pondered, as a thing of ſuch weighty concernment deſervs, we ſhall begin both to ſuſpect that the firſt reformers <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> who being Prieſts under that Papal hierarchy flew out againſt the Church whereof they had been members, and furiouſly cryed down both Pope and all epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, were not ſent from God; and likewiſe conclude, that the counſel of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> did wiſely reaſſume that ancient form of Church government, though it were oppoſite to the principles of reformation and judgment of all the firſt reformers; becaus it was both
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:121335:95"/>moſt conformable to times of primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and in all reaſon moſt likely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the land in unity. And if we were once by Gods grace freed from preconceived preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, we ſhould all of us as clearly ſee and love the beauty of papal doctrin, as now ſome of us allow of papal government: nor is there any thing commendable in any reformation, but that and only that, which it hath in it of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery: And laſtly we ſhall eaſily diſcern that the the Presbyterian plea and all its arguments, or whatever elſe they can have to ſay againſt epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, are of no value, and indeed too ſlight for me to inſiſt upon their ſolution.</p>
                  <p>I had a mind here to decipher the Proteſtants plea againſt the Papiſt; but I finde that there cannot be made any one ſcheme of it, as of the Independent and Presbyterians; becaus theſe, the firſt of them ſpeaks ſo generally of all things, that he ſeldom touches upon any one particular; the other ſo inſiſts upon one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, that he troubles himſelf with nothing elſe; and a man may know what both of them would have. But all theſe, and ſeveral other reformations when they ſet their face againſt the Roman Catholick, go all under the generall name of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and yet ſpeak ſeveral and contradictory things, one accuſing them for that which the other approves. And generally they do neglect their doctrin, and inveigh
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:121335:95"/>againſt the vices and follies which either they put upon them, or are indeed found amongſt ſom people or perſons that do profeſs that faith in <hi>France, Spain, Italy</hi> or other parts; as pride, tyranny, drunkennes, leachery, fooliſh gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols, and uſages of Countreys; with which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant books againſt popery are luſtily ſtuft up; or if they do indeed ſpeak to their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, it is either done onely with ſome witty jeſt and jeer, and ſo having given it a flap with a fox tail they paſs on ſoberly to other matters in hand, as is commonly done in the pulpits of witty preachers; or if they handle it more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, they do either for their own advantage miſtake the doctrin, or the proofs they bring againſt it, whether through fraud or ignorance 'tis hard to ſay: and the foundations of catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick religion which be tradition and ſcripture they do ſo variouſly expound in ſeverall times and places, that one text ſhall have twenty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral interpretations, which if they be not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick paſs all for good; here and at one time an autority of a father or councel ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and diverſly interpreted, in another time and place quite rejected; now one piece of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick doctrine ſhall be vehemently cryed down and at another time taken up again and maintained; and at one and the ſame time in ſeveral parts of the world twenty points for example of catholick faith ſhall all of them
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:121335:96"/>be ſomewhere received and ſomewhere rejected amongſt Proteſtants: for they being ſtill their own maiſters, may choos and throw away what they pleas, and as long as they liſt, without controul; wheras the <hi>Romans</hi> keeping ſtill one and the ſame treaſury of religion and faith af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford matter for them all either to take or leave, either to approve or laugh at as they l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>ANd whence com all theſe diviſions? only from this, that every man hath a reaſon, an interpretation, a light, a ſpirit of his own by which the bible which is now in all mens hands is made to ſpeak what we pleas, and our thoughts and tongues are our own, what lord ſhall us controul. This is a ſad caſe: while all of us, upon thoſe only motives which all men may take up at any time to abuſe his innocent neighbour, proceed to mutual hoſtility without end. The very books that have been written againſt Roman catholick this laſt hundred years, as they be furious and virulent, ſo be they alſo ſo many and various that they would if they
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:121335:96"/>were all brought together fill up the Tower of London; and by them have people been infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſuch a height againſt the Romans that their bodies, dignities, honours, fame, houſes and goods have been ineffably harraſſed to this day. And yet no body can ſay what ill that religion ever did in the world, until <hi>Henry</hi> the eights dayes when it was firſt rejected and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted: and when we have laid them in the duſt, we fly upon one another and pull and tear upon the ſame motiv all that ſtands in our light. Reflect countrimen upon your ſelves; ſhall we continue in a conteſt, that can never poſſibly be ended; and being proſecuted to the utmoſt muſt needs infer a general ruin upon all? for whatſoever we ſay againſt any one, may be ſaid by any other againſt our ſelves, and proved by the ſame argument; and the ſame thing may be done to us upon the ſame account we do it to another.</p>
                  <p>All appellation to a viſible judg is by anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catholicks jointly excluded; and to the Roman catholick with whom unity hath ever dwelt we will not return; nor can it be yet expected, for the general diſrepute unto that way hath ſo fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our ears and hearts, that hating the very name of <hi>Papiſt,</hi> we have not power to conſider ſoberly what their religion may be. Nay we are verily perſwaded even from our nurſes milk, that Proteſtants are the only profeſſors, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:121335:97"/>Papiſts enemies to the goſpel; although to all the world beſides, the goſpel is well enough known to be the Roman catholicks own and ſole religion, by which they walked and lived here in England many hundred years unto a fruitfulnes of all good works, before Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy appeared: and we pretend to fight againſt them only for the goſpel, and with the goſpel, whiles they forſooth are beleeved to have nothing at all to defend themſelvs, but a little traditional trumpery of mans inventions, with a greater heap of vices of their own. And upon this account proceed all our books that are written againſt Papiſts and popery; in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect like unto that picture that was carried not long ago up and down the Proteſtant world, wherein was drawn a fair ballance as a type of the two religions, in whoſe left hand ſcale hanged beads, girdles, cardinals caps, monks hoods, fryars cowles, diſciplines, croſſes, to ſignifie Popery; in the other a fair great Bible to ſignifie Proteſtancy; which hanging up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground quite weighed up the other ſcale into the air as light as very vanity. And ſo credulous is the generallity of mankind, that by ſuch toies as theſe we are carried away unto not onely a diſlike but even the higheſt deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and contempt of a ſacred religion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further examination. But what do I ſpeak of the generallity of the vulgar! Even our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:121335:97"/>and moſt judicious men, who in other things ſpeak and think like oracles, in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines of popery are not abaſhed to ſpeak like children that talk of hobgoblings in the dark; ſo prevalent is a prejudice brought upon us by the virulent impreſſion of often iterated calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Nor are we able by the reſtraint of this great prejudice either to read the books, or ponder ſeriouſly the reaſons of our catholick neighbours for their faith. Yea I have heard ſom Proteſtants in other things moſt wiſe and judicious to ſay openly, that as for Papiſts he loved their perſons, but their religion he hated in his heart: the reaſon is clear, he knew the one and not the other.</p>
                  <p>And as we do all of us by this old imbibed prejudice deteſt Popery though we know not what it is; ſo by any new-received diſlike, when we have once bodied with any one faction we revile all the reſt; and none will yield to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, although in all reaſon that religion that hath precedency of time with all the other helps any juniour way can pretend unto, might one would think have ſo much if not precedency yet equallity of reſpect, as not to be by a way that is new in the world ſo bitterly reviled; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when all that venemous bitterneſs which by any junior ſect is caſt upon his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goer, may and is as heavily thrown upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his ſucceſſour. But thus rancour and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:121335:98"/>malice ſpreads abroad in our hearts and whole kingdom againſt his rule and doubtles to his great diſpleaſure who carefully obliged us to the contrary rules of love; and, which is to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, the firſt ſours and origin of all theſe defamations is the Pulpit, where both by word and example we are taught to defame and hate even thoſe we do not know. We may fear ſom great curs lies upon our poor nation for theſe our unnatural diſorders, even ſo far as to blind us, that we cannot ſee the truth. Unto his dogs ſet upon their devouring ſport even <hi>Acteon</hi> the maiſter may ſeem a ſtag and be torn a pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by them. Wrath puts a new ſhape upon an adverſary, who through ſuch a black <hi>medium,</hi> though he be never ſo innocent in himſelf, will appear all odious; eſpecially when the wrath is unjuſt and the occaſion of it taken but not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for then 'tis curſed, and works marvellous dark effects in the heart of him that bears it. And by this we may ſuſpect our ſelves to be blaſted with ſuch an unwarrantable paſſion, when upon a conceived prejudice of our own we do more hate thoſe have don us good, than ſuch as really hurt us. I cannot but take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that our learned proteſtant, all theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years he hath by the Puritan been outed of his eccleſiaſtical poſſeſſions, he wrote little or nothing againſt him and with no conſiderable violence; but moſt virulent books he put forth
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:121335:98"/>continually againſt the Papiſt who did him no harm and meddled not at all with him, and then hanged with him upon the ſame croſs of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and might juſtly reply unto him as the good thief to the evil one, <hi>Nunquid tu non De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um times qui in eadem damnatione es.</hi> And what evil hath the Proteſtant ever received from the Roman catholick that he ſhould treat him thus? even none at all, but all good imaginable: The Proteſtant hath been inſtructed in his Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities (for Oxford and Cambridg were both of them built by Catholicks as well as the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrals and pariſh Churches) he hath lived all his life upon their benefices, ſtudies their books, preaches in their pulpits even that goſpel which he had from catholick archives; this is the harm the catholick ever did, or the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant received from him; and yet, Lord what volumes of invectives do we powre forth even to this day againſt him who hath done us all good and never any harm at all, neglecting in a manner the true adverſary who hath utterly undon us. Is not this a piece of phrenſy? what can one think it els, when any nips us behinde to fly into the face and ſcratch him that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently ſtands before us, our maiſter and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour. But the Proteſtant ſeeing that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage done unto him, which he had done to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks before, upon the very ſame motives, and with the like words and deeds, might fear
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:121335:99"/>perhaps that himſelf ſhould now appear juſtly puniſhed, and the catholick at length be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified.</p>
                  <p>But let us ſee a little further, if our hot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting combatants can find any rational me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium to conclude demonſtrativly, or maintain infallibly, or know certainly any thing at all concerning points of religion. If they cannot, they have ſom reaſon to be ſilent, none to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel; either one with another, or all of them againſt the Roman catholick.</p>
                  <p>The wayes and practis of a viſible foregoing Church is concluded by a general conſent of all, the Catholick only excepted, to be erroneous; antiquity of former ages overwhelmed with Egyptian darknes; conciliary meetings of by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and paſtours a conſpiracy againſt purity of goſpel; and the Pope who was anciently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved ſole judg and general paſtour over all, a grand ſeducer: and now ſcripture though it be wreſted out of the hands of Papiſts, that ſomthing might be held by us which is plauſible, muſt be not the truth only, but the ſole judg of it too. This is it we all pretend to ſtand upon. Be it then admitted for truth, who has the right meaning of it? the Roman catholick who hath lived by it now above ſixteen hundred years in all unanimity, or the Proteſtants who wreſting it out of catholick hands about one hundred year ago hath ever ſince been conteſting and quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:121335:99"/>about it, not only with the catholick but amongſt themſelvs even to this preſent day. The goſpel is no doubt a good rule, but if we for our own ends to avoid the judgment of any tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal upon earth do conſtitute our ſelves, each one the ſole ſpeaking judg by that rule, we do thereby make our ſelves both judg and rule too; for it is all one, to arbitrate with a mans own words, or to do it with another bodies words which he without controul will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret: and thus excluding one judg whom we found in actual poſſeſſion of the chair we ſet up a thouſand, who will determin more raſhly and yet as reſolutely as he, and we ſtill further off from any final concluſion than before. Do we not ſee this to be true by the daily freſh upriſe of ſo many ſeveral ſects, which do all promote themſelvs by vertue of the ſame pretens. Theſe twenty years laſt paſt the zelots who preached ſo vehemently againſt our innocent good King all the land over, did they not all find a text in ſcripture for their purpos; and not only one text to preach upon, but hundred others to elucidate and confirm their doctrin; which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all wiſe men knew were not taken in their own genuin ſens and meaning, and yet who could convince them of that, who had as much light within, and without too, as all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy ever taught ſufficient for judgment even againſt him who firſt ſent us the ſcriptur
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:121335:100"/>and was then found in actual poſſeſſion of the chair: and a Proteſtant that ſhould have gone about to confute them, muſt have denied the principles by which he was himſelf firſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted. Com, com, 'tis more than manifeſt by all our proceedings this hundred year, that our bitter invectives againſt the Pope who ſwayed Chriſtianity had no other end but only this, that we might all ſway and none of us be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled.</p>
                  <p>I would fain know if I ſhould deny the great fundamental upon which all religion is built; namely that the ſoul of man is an immortal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and diſtinct not only from the groſſer tangible parts, but even from the very beſt and pureſt both animal and vital ſpirits, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt be mortal, and that there is any other world for men to paſs into after this life of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability; whether I could not ſufficiently prove my negative out of ſcripture, making uſe of all the advantages of ſemiſentences, parables, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, ſtories, tropes, with as much reaſon, light and ſpirit, and as equal plauſibility, as any ſect deduces their tenets: and ſo another likewiſe, who ſhould hold that heaven and the world to com, is nothing but a condition of ſerenity in this life; a fourth that there is no hell angels or divels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſith there is no tribunal to judg, who can outbrave any ſuch defendant when he faces his antagoniſt with the light of a text,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:121335:100"/>which none but himſelf muſt underſtand.</p>
                  <p>Scripture muſt do all, by that light all walk, how many ſoever ſeveral gainſaying paths they tread. I will no further conteſt about the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: What is this Scripture? <hi>It is Gods word.</hi> But you had it not immediately from God, but found it in other mens hands, all whom from one <hi>ſeries</hi> to another till you come to the Pope who firſt ſent it us, we have all aforetime concluded to be liars; ſo that you muſt take it then upon the credit of thoſe who by your own principles may as well deceive you as you me. Can you tell who wrote that book? O yes, you name me preſently twenty ſeveral perſons, which you can no more prove to be authours of the books, than any thing contained in the writings, although their names may be there prefixed Thoſe perſons at leaſt as they were men of ſeveral conditions, prieſts, kings, lawyers, poets, hiſtorians, fiſhermen, doctours, ſo did they live in ſeveral times and places of the world, and differ both in theſe things and alſo in their very ſtile and manner of writing as much as any can do. A brachman in <hi>India</hi> teacher of morality two thouſand years ago, <hi>William</hi> the conqueror King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſix hundred years ago dictatour of our law; and our Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby</hi> Knight and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, lately author of a Natural Philoſophy. Do theſe three differ any more then St. John,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:121335:101"/>Moſes and Salomon, either for time, place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or ſtile of writing? I trow not: how then came all thoſe with ſo much diverſity of their own to write the word of God more than theſe; and how they and no other? Who firſt gave them their autority? or was it given or onely declared, and by what power and vertue could it be declared by any that knew them not, and lived ſo long after them? How com laws, poems, ſermons, hiſtories, letters, viſions, ſo many ſeveral fanſies in ſuch diverſity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure to be dictated from one divine hand? and how do they conſpire together in ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of times to make at length one vlume of faith? And yet too, they muſt not all be either of ſignification or validity, juſt as they lye and ſound; but ſome in this manner ſome in that. Moſes law muſt not bind in its judicial or cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial part, which makes up in a manner all the whole Pentateuch, but onely in the truth of ſtory and morality: ſome books muſt be taken according to the literal ſenſe, and not in any myſtical one, ſome in the myſtery and not the letter, and ſom again according to both. What ſhall guide us in theſe things? a parable muſt not be looked on as a ſtory, nor yet moralliſed in all its pars, but onely in the capital intention; no words muſt be culled forth to prove any thing out of the road of his mind and purpoſe who ſpake them; no axiom of holy writ is to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:121335:101"/>be taken by halves, nor yet in any ſenſe was not thought of by the authour; an objection is not to be propoſed for a concluſion, nor any trope or metaphor perverted, all words muſt ſpeak to the writers ſcope not againſt it, as he made them to do who brought texts againſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Saints out of St. <hi>Jo. Chryſoſtoms</hi> ſpeeches made expreſly in honour of them, and others againſt monarchy drawn out of the book of <hi>Kings:</hi> and many ſuch like cautions there be, I cannot now think of. What autority or rule ſhall conduct us in all theſe uncertainties? The Catholick indeed has one by which he paſſes on uniformly and quietly in the courſe of his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as the ſun in the firmament without noiſe or trouble, but others jumble and juſtle one againſt another like coaches in a ſtreet. <hi>O the Scripture, and truth therein contained will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it ſelf.</hi> Does it not very fairly? whiles we are all of us together by the ears not for the Bible but with it. <hi>You muſt beleeve.</hi> What ſhould I beleev and why? I expect a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to beleev not a command, and to hear not that I muſt beleev but what; and not onely what to credit, but why and wherefore. <hi>O but you may diſcern in theſe writings the very marks of Gods hand appearing.</hi> Though there be ſuch marks, yet it ſeems by our many diviſions we cannot read of our ſelves what thoſe marks would have, or what Church and doctrin they
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:121335:102"/>would eſtabliſh: and to whom can thoſe marks appear to be Gods, but to them only who have ſeen Gods hand aforetime or ſtood by him when he wrote. <hi>Porphirius</hi> was as good a marks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and underſtanding Philoſopher as perhaps ever was, and yet he deſerted Chriſtianity and all the whole Bible for want of the marks of divinity in it, as others for the ſame reaſon have at times rejected many particular books; I ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie neither him nor them, but only ſpeak thus much to ſhow how inſtable a thing man is, when he relyes upon his own judgment. Have not we known wicked hypocrites to ſpeak as fine words as any be in ſcriptur, and by thoſe their marks to deceiv many? and I doubt not but Antichriſt when he appears will do ſo.</p>
                  <p>But how came this book into England? for it was not it ſeems any part of it written here? It was brought hither, you will ſay, at the lands firſt converſion all of it together in one volume. If this be true, as true indeed it is, then we had it from the Pope of Rome, whether we ſpeak of the converſion of Engliſhmen or Brittons. And ſhall I build my beleef upon the autority of a book, if indeed it could make it out, ſent us from him whom our own miniſters do pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly proclaim to be an impoſtour and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt? or can I in reaſon ſo condemn him and not ſuſpect it? If he did not onely preſent it us, but made his catholick beleevers with ſo
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:121335:102"/>much labour and induſtry to tranſcribe it all the world over before printing was invented, as a ſacred and venerable thing; a man might think in reaſon there were ſomthing in it to favour him and his religion, which being once accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the notion of divine writings men would not eaſily dare to contradict, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all againſt him. <hi>O but the Pope did not make the book, nor any of his predeceſſors.</hi> This is more than either you or I can prove, ſith that book ſo much of it as belongs to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, was never found in our countrey but as taken and ſent from him; and it is no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make a book for my own ends, and for its ampler autority to father it upon ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned perſon, the better to promote my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. Truly ſuch places as ſpeak ſo plainly the Churches autority, the real preſence, abſolution of ſins by man, epiſcopal government, and the like papal doctrin, are apt enough to ſuggeſt ſuch thoughts; and ſome of our firſt reformers upon that very account did ſhrewdly ſuſpect, and were not afraid to ſay it, that the Pope had at leaſt a finger in many ſuch like places, which he might in their opinion eaſily do, when he had once overwhelmed the earth with his miſts of errour, and made the people ſo credulous, that he might do what he pleaſed. And if I do indeed think the Pope to be Antichriſt and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer, I cannot rationally beleev or truſt unto
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:121335:103"/>any book he ſends me, more than I do to his doctrin which he ſayes is there grounded, ſith I have indeed but his word for the autority of both; and let me once give a freedom to my thoughts, I ſhall as ſoon queſtion one as the other, and if I do reject one proceeding ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally I muſt caſhier the other alſo. Surely the Pope canot but ſmile, to ſee his book which is the ground and guide of the catholick faith he delivered with it, to be made by the Proteſtant to ſpeak proteſtantiſme, presbyteriſme by the Presbyterian, anabaptiſme by the Anabaptiſt, and quakeriſme by the Quaker; even as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les it would be a ſport to <hi>Virgil,</hi> if he were alive, to ſee his <hi>Arma virumque cano</hi> turned epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalamiſt by one, a prophetiſt by another, an evangeliſt by a third, whereas the poem it ſelf intends none of theſe things, but only the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels and wars of <hi>Eneas;</hi> and doubtles our ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it ſelf might be made by theſe tricks of wit to ſpeak forth the paſſions of Queen <hi>Dido.</hi> Without all doubt and controul, it is a moſt high inconſequence, ſo paſſionately as we do to plaſpheme a byſhop, who is and ever was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in the world for <hi>Pape</hi> or Father of Chriſtianity as the moſt wicked man alive and a grand ſeducer; and yet to hugge a book in our boſomes which we took at firſt upon his credit as an oracle of truth; and then again firſt to fall out with him, and then with one another
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:121335:103"/>amongſt our ſelves, about the meaning of that book, wherein his own catholick beleevers all the while unanimouſly agree, without any end pelting one another with texts and verſes unto the utter ruin of charity, not underſtanding for the moſt part either the uncertainty of our own reaſonings or the dangerous conſequence of our wayes.</p>
                  <p>I will utter a bold word, but what I know to be true both by experience and irrefragable reaſon. As the goſpel cannot prove any thing being ſeparated from the Church and the living and ſpeaking oracle of him that ſent it, unto whoſe judgment both defendant and diſputant muſt ſubmit; ſo neither without the help of that autority can it prove it ſelf, either by any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which it uſes none, or by vertue of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle recorded in it: ſith thoſe ſigns and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders there related are now as far from my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, as be the truths of any doctrins to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by them: ſo that I ſhall have as much ado to beleev them as any piece of doctrin they may confirm; being all of them equally either motives or objects of beleef as I pleas my ſelf. And it is all one to me that am born in theſe dayes, ſo long after thoſe ſigns were wrought, to beleev the miracles by Gods incarnation, or Gods incarnation by the miracles: ſince I may beleev both, but can evidently know neither of them to be true; ſo far as that I may uſe one of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:121335:104"/>them as a <hi>medium</hi> to demonſtrate the other. If the goſpel laid before me ſhould work of it ſelf any ſtrang wonder in my ſight, then I might haply have ſome motive to beleev it; but we in England inveigh bitterly againſt the preſent miracles, that are ſhown in the catholick Church, aſcribing them all, if they be true, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the operations of Satan; ſo that according to this way I ſhould not know what to think neither, if the bible ſhould do ſom ſtrang thing before me, and as little conclude of the paſt miracles there recorded.</p>

                  <p>AS it is impoſſible to be aſſured that the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is the word of God, if we condemn him from whom it firſt came of impoſture; ſo is it certain, that upon that book wreſted out of the hands of catholicks againſt him and his who firſt preſented it, we ground all the ſeveral wayes of religion here in England whereof each body and faction does ſo far preſume as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all to death who will not approve them. And yet, if we did but proceed like rational men, we could not but remain all of us in great humility and fear, upon theſe ſurmiſes. Does not the Pope pretend the ſpirit of Chriſt as well as we? do not all catholicks ſo? had we not
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:121335:104"/>the bible from them? do they not ratiocinate out of it and ſhow their religion thence as well as we? only they do it uniformly, we different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and upon their principles they build up Church and State, we pull down all. Put caſe we were all at this inſtant in our antient ſtate of paganiſme, and a Prieſt or two ſhould com to us from Rome to convert us now as then they did to Chriſtianity with the goſpel in their hands, which they ſhould tell us to be pure truth and Gods word, which we never heard before: if we ſhould reject and diſeſteem them as cheating ſeducers, could we rationally accept and beleev the book? or would we not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for caſt into the fire that volum of theirs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were contained the ſumme of all their miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and news, if we looked upon the men that brought it as impoſtours. Conſider ſeriouſly, and think not to pull the ſnail out of her ſhell, and then to keep one apart and cruſh the other without which it cannot liv. Church and Goſpel were both born together, but the Church firſt, at leaſt in a priority of nature, and muſt both liv together. Chriſt the head muſt be autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed before he could teach, and the Church eſtabliſhed before any of her children could write a goſpel: nor can they with authentick autority write any thing, but what the mother Church conſtituted by her eſpous the ſours of all heavenly truths that earth can expect, ſhall
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:121335:105"/>ſet her ſeal unto. So that in any age to deny the Church and to accept of her writings, to profeſs Chriſt and condemn her that brought us the firſt news of him, is at one and the ſame time to take her autority and reject it; to ſay ſhe is fals and yet true in the ſame affairs. As ſhe gave teſtimony to Chriſt ſo did Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her. The ſame goſpel ratifies both Chriſt and his Church, the ſame Church both Chriſt and the goſpel, the ſame Chriſt both goſpel and the Church too which himſelf eſtabliſhed. So then; reaſon, light, ſcripture, power of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation being equally to be found at leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in all anticatholick wayes; and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man catholick although he have withal a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage of true and right autority from the Church and her paſtour whom he ever follows, yet ſince he never denied, but ſtrongly and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuouſſy maintained, that he hath with him as much of true interpretation, light and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as any can pretend; and ſo far more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and excelling, as the judgment of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church in all ages from whence he drew that reaſon and light of his, is in matters of religion that are not invented but derived, to be preferred before the conceit of any one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who contrary to the very eſſence and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of antient Chriſtianity ſhall go out of the Church wherein he found himſelf; it may moſt manifeſtly appear, that as the catholick hath all
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:121335:105"/>the right and preheminence that any other may pretend for himſelf, and yet a far greater too, even that autority which can onely conſtitute religion; ſo likewiſe all anticatholicks both In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Presbyterian and Proteſtant have the ſame power and advantage each one againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other which any other may pretend againſt him; ſcripture, eaſy ſcripture, interiour light and ſpirit; whiles none of them will in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim admit of any living judg, nor of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority of a foregoing Church wherein they found themſelvs when they firſt went out and changed. And I have already ſaid and truly ſaid, that no man ever yet was impowred even from heaven to go out of the general flock, but to have recours unto it, nor conſidering the order God hath ſet ever can be. Nor is there any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer rule of diſcerning a fals pretenſion than that of the Apoſtle <hi>Exierunt ex nobis,</hi> which if it held good in the Church when that apoſtle was alive, it muſt needs do ſo unto all generations ſo long as the Church remains by vertue of him who promiſed to confirm it, and therein his deity muſt chiefly appear, even vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of the world. And if we conſider the firſt ingreſs of all theſe religions, we ſhall find that the catholick faith entred our land firſt, and chaſed hence our antient paganiſme; after it had been here exiſtent a thouſand years the Proteſtant went forth out of it, the Puritan by
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:121335:106"/>and by out of the Proteſtant, not to mention any further ſubdiviſion; and the catholick reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion entered by vertue of her own powerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, all the others by force either of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Sword: that Church as ſhe entered peaceably ſo ſhe remained quietly all the time of her ſtay in the Kingdom, but the others neither ſtay nor enter without diſturbance; ſhe hath a rule to go by and a judg to ſubmit unto in all affairs; others as they will be their own judg, ſo muſt the rule ſpeak as they liſt and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; which manner of proceeding if it have its free cours muſt needs work much diſorder in a kingdom.</p>
                  <p>I have often marvelled that theſe various wayes of religion here in England which mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply without end or any hope of reconciliation, have not all this while appealed to the ſacred majeſty of the King who hath been acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all the parties, to be ſupreme in all his kingdoms as well in ſpirituals as temporals, and head as well of the Church as State: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly had this been don, and that all had reſted upon his verdict as they ought by reaſon of their own acknowledgment to do, much miſchief had been prevented. But we were ſo far all of us from doing ſo, that on the contrary firſt we ſecretly murmured againſt both Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi> and then broke forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to open hoſtility againſt his ſon. Indeed that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:121335:106"/>private ſwelling of the murmuring waters were an ill boding omen of the vaſt tempeſt which followed afterwards in the reign of our good King <hi>Charls;</hi> with ſo diſmal and violent a rage, that it both ſplit the ſhip and drowned our pilot. We did not appeal then with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his judgment, as by our own law and agreement upon our revolt from Popery we ought to have don, but forced him imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to our own; and when in right reaſon he could not conſent unto it, we made no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to deſtroy and cut off not ſo much his head as our own: which being a ſingular unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd piece of inſolent cruelty never yet acted before upon earth, it will remain an eternal blemiſh both upon the men and religion too ſo long as the world laſteth. Did we ſincerely think our King to be head as well of Church as of State? how then durſt we ſubjugate him to our ſelves in the affairs of both; and under pretens of purity of religion oppreſs him, from whom under God all our religion ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived as the head and ſours of it.</p>
                  <p>The body may prepare blood and vital ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to be preſented to the head; but of theſe are not made animal ſpirits, till the head re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivs and makes them ſuch for the good of the whole; and from the head com down all thoſe influences that be fitted and proportioned unto that life which the animal lives. So may and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:121335:107"/>ought every kingdom, either apart or in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament aſſemblies, to propoſe affairs unto their head, but can take none as authentick till he have determined and derived them to us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther civil or ſpiritual, if ſo be he be head of both, reſting quiet within our ſelves both before and after he hath don it: for what hand or foot ever queſtioned the ſpirits which the head deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it or pretended either to mend or make them. But we have by theſe our proceedings condemned our ſelves if we do not indeed think him our ſpiritual head as we profeſs in words, of viſe hypocriſie; if we do beleev him ſo, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequent madnes. But to remove the Pope, the King is head with us, and to remove the King the people is head, and to remove one another each particular perſon is his own head. So arbitrary a thing it is with us, to ſet up and pull down power at our pleaſur.</p>
                  <p>It would ſeem very ſtrang to a rational man, that the Pope who is in our eſteem the worſt of men ſhould keep together the people of many kingdoms, which as they be not at all ſubject to him in civil affairs, ſo are they very divers among themſelves, both in habits, manners, language, lawes, and other weighty reſpects and inclinations, in a conſtant unity of religion from age to age: and yet a noble vertuous prudent King ſhould not be able to do ſo much among his own ſubjects all of one guarb, one
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:121335:107"/>law, one language, for one age together: the Pope all the while we beleev to be a fals and onely pretended Head, the King an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and true one. This is a greater ſecret: and yet greater too upon this account, that if any ſhould fall away from the Popes religion, the apoſtate runs himſelf into no more danger upon that account than what he willingly brings upon himſelf, the loſs of further communion with him and his Church; for the Popes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication ſignifies no more, and all the Pope can do is but to excommunicate him, who before by his own voluntary act put himſelf out of his communion. But the King hath a temporal ſword in his hand to take corporal reveng upon rebellion and apoſtacy, and the people ſubject to him in faith are likewiſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in other temporal reſpects, and by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt him hazzard their eſtates and lives.</p>
                  <p>I know well enough that Popes are generally as civil and accompliſhed gentlemen as be in Europe, and for the moſt part very learned; yet can I never beleev but that there be others in the Chriſtian world, both prieſts doctours, and byſhops as learned as the pope himſelf, and as wiſe too and accompliſht perſons in any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections either natural or moral; and yet can none but He, hit upon this feat of guiding the Chriſtian flock in unity and peace: Nay, which
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:121335:108"/>yet augments the wonder, take any one king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom under his ſpiritual juriſdiction, and they ſhall remain a hundred yea thouſand years in all peace and unity upon religions account: But let that kingdom once divide and ſeparate from him; and preſently all thoſe very ſelf ſame byſhops who before in their ſubordination to the Pope eaſily mannaged the peoples conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and kept them in a moſt orderly peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, not know in their ſeparation from him, which way to turn themſelves, but that hereſies and ſchiſmes will riſe and augment themſelves without end in deſpight of all their power and endeavours, as if unity and truth and peace were tied to the Popes chair. Thoſe that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not catholick religion have ſtood ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them exceedingly amazed at this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and not without caus: for whence can this happen? It is not becaus Popes are all ſaints and only they; for the venerable and renowned prieſts under him, and great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of people about him in all nations, which ſhine like ſtars in the firmament, may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controul as good and holy many of them as himſelf: and although Popes be for the moſt part very good, civil and diſcreet men, yet if it ſhould happen that ſom one be no better than he ſhould, yet even that man ſhall be as zealous of unity in religion and preſerv it as exactly as the beſt; which exalts our wonderment unto
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:121335:108"/>ſuch a height, that we are even forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg that there is ſome great ſecret in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not eaſily to be reſolved: for all other by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and princes the more worldly and ſenſual they be, the leſs care have they of their flock and people. If we ſhall ſay that theſe be the great powers of God upon him, the doubt is at an end, and a reaſon appears why people do fear ſo much to be excluded his communion: if this be not admitted, I am at a loſs, and can find no reaſon, why a good king and true head of his Church, if himſelf or the people can make him ſo, ſhould not be able by his acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged autority and ſword to keep his own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in an unity of faith and peace, as well as a bad Pope, for ſo we beleev them all to be, and pretended head keeps together other mens ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of different manners and languages with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſword or axe or corporal rods, only by the meer love of his communion and fear they have to loſe it.</p>
                  <p>Nor can we ſay that new opinions about reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are never broacht among catholiks: for this as it cannot be expected amongſt ſo many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of great wits and ſpirits that be amongſt them up and down the world; ſo is it ſo far from being true, that all the hereſies that have roſe in Chriſtianity were invented ever by ſome catholick, I mean that had been formerly ſuch, for his oppoſition to and apoſtacy from his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:121335:109"/>Paſtour makes him ceas to be catholick any longer, and generally by prieſts, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring their own judgments before their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours and the tradition they had hitherto walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by, in the pride of their hearts led people after them out of the fold of the Church. And whoever does ſo, puts himſelf by his own auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>in locum Petri,</hi> and is to be looked upon by all good Catholicks who have care of their own ſalvation as a dangerous guide. Thus did firſt begin our own Proteſtancy by <hi>Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Calvin,</hi> and other fallen prieſts; and the fall of murmuring <hi>Judas</hi> from the colledg of apoſtles, of conteſting <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> from the bliſs of paradiſe, of diſſenting <hi>Lucifer</hi> and his angels from heaven, who are ſaid to diſpute with <hi>Michael</hi> and his angels, as <hi>Luther</hi> did with <hi>Eckius</hi> and his fellow Catholicks, ſignifie nothing elſe.</p>
                  <p>But what does the Pape or Chriſtian paſtour do in this caſe. When the tumult is once rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and a diſorder begun in any part of his flock by ſom proud turbulent ſpirit amongſt them, the Pape firſt whiſtles him and his fellow petul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous rams into order by charitable admonition, which ſtill increaſes lowder by degrees: and if this will not ſerv, but that they will ſtill be refractory, he caſts in his ſhepheards crook amongſt them, and divides the turbulent from the peaceful, and ſo the infection ſtayes. The
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:121335:109"/>diſquiet ones being driven out, depart in a rout together; but within a while they ſeparate, and walk by ſixes and ſeavens, and ſubdivide at length ſo often, that at laſt they go ſingle, whiles every ſheep amongſt them will be a ram, and every ram a ſhepheard. But the other quiet ones that hear the voice of their ſheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd and follow him in peace as becoms ſheep to do, enjoy all happines and ſpiritual content amongſt themſelvs to the unſpeakable comfort of their ſouls, under him whom Chriſt the great Meſſias hath ſet over them: and this is called the <hi>Catholick flock,</hi> which for the love they bear to their honoured paſtour and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and ſomtimes, becaus they will not forſake either their ſheapheard or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine paſtures of truth and ſacraments wherein they have been brought up, when we would ſpeak more civilly, we call them <hi>Recuſants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any one ſhall think I ſpeak too much in favour of catholick religion, let ſuch know that I favour nothing but truth and peace: and it is the part of an ingenuous and well bred na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſupport what he can the weaker ſide; eſpecially if he know it to be innocent and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly oppreſt, as it often happens in this world that the ſtronger in right may be the weaker in repute. Nor can any fewd amongſt us ever be ended, which is the thing I aim at, ſo long as errour and injuſtice are maintained.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:121335:110"/>And although we quarrel furiouſly one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, yet conſidering that our ſtrifes amongſt our ſelves proceed upon the very ſame grounds and motives we pretend all of us to have againſt the general adverſary we all hate, till this capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſlike of Popery be diminiſhed our other fewds muſt needs be kept alive. No peace amongſt our ſelves; till we revoke our words and ill deeds againſt our innocent neighbours, and at laſt comply charitably with them againſt whom our firſt diſſention ſprang up in this land. <hi>Ephraim</hi> is againſt <hi>Manaſſes</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but both againſt <hi>Juda;</hi> and becaus they are both againſt <hi>Juda</hi> their lawful ſuperiour, therefor are they ſo furiouſly bent againſt one another, whiles <hi>Ephraim</hi> to be in <hi>Juda's</hi> place, who is thruſt out by both parties, labours to depreſs <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes</hi> for the ſame reaſon to trample upon <hi>Ephraim.</hi> Thus is <hi>Presbyterian</hi> againſt <hi>Independent,</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> againſt <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> but both againſt the <hi>Papiſt: Proteſtant</hi> againſt <hi>Puritan,</hi> and <hi>Puritan</hi> againſt <hi>Proteſtant</hi> but both againſt the <hi>Catholick.</hi> And as ſoon as the Proteſtant had by violence ſupplanted and caſt his Roman-neighbours out of all their dignities honour and livelihood; the rancour had utterly ceaſed, had not the Puritan roſe up out of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant bowels and ſubverted him by the ſame means he had uſed to his catholick foregoers:
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:121335:110"/>and when this was don it had ceaſed again, had not Presbyterian, Anabaptiſt and Independent ſprung out of the Puritan diſturbed one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and all the land by the ſame ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Haſlerig</hi> and <hi>Vane</hi> two grand Puritans, antient and mortal enemies both of them unto Roman catholicks, when at length they fell out and jarred in this laſt Rump. Parliament, they did both in publick and private with the utmoſt rage imaginable object <hi>Popery</hi> to one another, which they judged both of them to be both the extremeſt vilification could be caſt upon any one, and alſo moſt advantageous to him that objects it: every mouth and book in the long Parliaments time ſaid no leſs of the Kings army wherewith he defended himſelf, that they were all Papiſts and Popiſhly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: all the adherents of — Tectour Oliver after he had broken and ſhamefully diſmiſt the long Parliament, ſaid the like of it: the friends of the diſſolved long Parliament, which were a conſiderable part of the land aſſerted the like of <hi>Oliver</hi> and his ſouldiers; and ſo did great ſtore of good Proteſtants otherwiſe grave men ſay confidently that the red coat ſouldiers were all Jeſuites and Papiſts: and the ſame red coat ſoldiers both ſwindged and pillaged all the land upon the ſame account, laying popery to us all, and made us ſmart for it over and over; as if
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:121335:111"/>the very notion and name of <hi>Popery</hi> had even turned our brains and made us all mad. If we do but hear any one ſay of his neighbour that he is a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> our blood riſes preſently againſt him whom we never ſaw; and if we know him one, we ſhall beleev any evil that is ſpoken of him be it never ſo incredible or even impoſſible; and are apt to imagin and ſpeak it our ſelves in any place. A rational man would hardly beleev that ſom Engliſh men ſhould report confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently even in Rome to the citiſens there, that the Parliament men and judges who murdered our good King here in England were moſt of them papiſts, who indeed were all of them more profeſt enemies to the Papiſt or Catholick than to the King himſelf. So that the malice of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery once taken away, and as it expreſſes ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick religion it deſerves none, we ſhould not know in our religious feudes what to object to one another for diſparagement. It would ſeem a ſtrang thing, if after all our warres and the miſchiefs we have either done or intended one another upon the account of popery, it ſhould prove at laſt ſo good and ſincere a religion, that we can never more truly commend our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour than when we lay popery to his charg de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly, nor ever act greater iniquity than when we perſecute him upon that account. But indeed if popery be taken as it is now concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for a fardel of iniquity fraud and treachery,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:121335:111"/>then it will leaſt agree to them it is moſt put upon and is indeed proper only unto them who impoſe it upon others.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto I have endeavoured to take all men off from any baſis of private interpretation, reaſon, or light within themſelvs, whereupon they may raiſe a new religion, and wars and broils to maintain it againſt the Church out of which they ſallied. And by this the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent loſes his conceived advantage againſt the Presbyterian, this his againſt the Proteſtant, and the Proteſtant his againſt the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. What we are to fix upon I have here and there intermingled, although very ſparingly; and he told us it long ago who ſaid. If any will be my diſciple, let him <hi>deny</hi> himſelf.</p>

                  <p>I Have proceeded hitherto with a kind of negligent carefulnes, as I may ſo call it, not lapping up my diſcours with pithy ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentations and a formal order, but let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:121335:112"/>it flow looſe and intermingled, that it may delight all; and withall profit any that will read ſeriouſly; but now that theſe contents of my fourth chapter may connaturally appear unto the ſight of every one, I will to refreſh my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders appetite, a little leave even that method too; and that he may diſcern of himſelf without any further diſcours of mine, both how all the ſeveral wayes of religion here in England are equally innocent, and withall that the Roman catholick is abſolutely unblamable, I will make a brief narration of the ingreſs and progreſs of Chriſtianity in this land unto theſe preſent times and leav the concluding inference unto every mans own judgment. Truth needs not the help of art, and its very natural appearance is the beſt argument can be made for it. I know there be many eagleſighted men, that are able to trace the proceedings of ſtates and policy and religion from far, yet becaus generally men live at home and ſee no further than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which ſuffices nothing at all for judgment in theſe our turbulent affairs, I muſt crave leav of thoſe great heroes very briefly to run over that ſtory, which although they do well enough know already, yet to the generality of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whom in this my diſcours I ſerv and labour for, is ſo utterly unknown that they do not ſo much as dream of any ſuch thing.</p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:121335:112"/>
                  <p>In the thirty fifth year of our Lord when <hi>Sulpitius Galba</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Sylla</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls, all the Chriſtians in Jeruſalem except only the apoſtles being diſperſt abroad upon that great perſecution which cut off St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> the Church of God did ſpread and propagate upon that occaſion into ſeveral countries, not only of Judea and Samaria, but Phaenicia, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus, Antioch, Damaſcus, and round about be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the borders of Paleſtin. At that time <hi>Lazarus, Mary Magdalen, Martha</hi> with <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cella</hi> her handmaid, <hi>Maximin</hi> a diſciple, and <hi>Joſeph of Arimathea</hi> that noble decurion, againſt whom the Jews were more vehemently incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, were after much pillaging and many inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious affronts put together into a ſhip without ſail; in which notwithſtanding by the conduct of that providence they worſhiped, they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſafe at laſt in Marſelles in France; where <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph of Arimathea</hi> ſo far companion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon danger with them left them to divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and is ſaid, haply by means of ſome Brittiſh merchant in thoſe coaſts, to have ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thence into this our iſle of Britanny, where by the power of his words and holy life ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving converted many of our Brittons unto faith, he ended his dayes; the teſtimony of whoſe ſanctity that ſtrange thorn of <hi>Glaſenbury abbey</hi> which grew green and flouriſhed every Chriſtmas day remained even to our times.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:121335:113"/>This ſtory of a fact ſo long ago atchieved, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be obſcured by that viciſſitude of time which at length buries all things; yet it ſervs ſo much as we have of it, to ſhew that the religion he brought was catholick, ſince the ſame antiquities that ſpeak his arrival here, and his converſion of people, mention their erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of croſſes, ſhrines, oratories, altars, mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries and the like things of catholick profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on don by him and the people he converted.</p>
                  <p>But partly by the great ſucceeding perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions raiſed by the Roman emperours againſt Chriſtianity, partly by the unwearied endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the Pagan prieſts here in the land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, about the time of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> the Roman emperour, and year of our Lord 190. there were hardly any remnants of it left in this iſland. Wherefore our noble Brittiſh King <hi>Lucius</hi> moved by the fame of that holy faith ſent to <hi>Eleutherius</hi> then Pope in Rome, to entreat he would deſtin into our countrey ſome of his ſpecial paſtours to teach us his Chriſtian faith. The Pope ſent him two good prieſts, <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatius</hi> and <hi>Damian,</hi> who arriving here with ſome few others who were pleaſed to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them, made both the King himſelf and his Queen and very many of his ſubjects Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
                  <p>And this Chriſtianity of the Brittons no man I think will doubt it to be catholick; ſince the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:121335:113"/>whole profeſſion of it both while the Brittons lived in this land, and after that they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the Pagan Saxes into the mountains of Wales, doth clearly manifeſt it; if Prieſts living together in monaſteries, ſome hundreds of them many times together, and exerciſing in Churches their prieſtly functions upon the reall and myſticall body of Chriſt, if praying before crucifixes, erecting of croſſes, ſolemnizing of feaſts, keeping of Lent, vigils and embers, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of Saints, making oblations and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the dead, may as it needs muſt ſignifie ſo much: Nor can it be imagined that Pope <hi>Eleutherius</hi> ſent to us by his Prieſts any other religion than his own. And this is called <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> ſecond converſion, as that by <hi>Joſeph of Arimathea</hi> the firſt: and both of them equally to one and the ſame catholik faith and no other; which however now by a ſtrange judgment of heaven it be for a time traduced, yet in primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ages it was looked upon as a moſt ſacred and bleſſed religion, and then perſecuted by none but ſuch as were profeſt enemies to Chriſt himſelf; as I could ſhow at large; but I muſt make haſte.</p>
                  <p>After two or three hundred years this Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion all that while profeſt in the land was again baniſhed by the utter overthrow and flight of the Brittons profeſſors of it into our engliſh Alps in Wales, where Chriſtian and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:121335:114"/>Chriſtianity lay hid together: and the pagan Saxes who had driven them out equally hated both their faith and them. Wherefor about the year of our Lord 596 the time of empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Mauritius,</hi> Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, of his own proper motion and good will towards us deſtined unto the converſion of the <hi>Saxes</hi> or <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> who being then pagans had poſſeſt themſelvs of all the Engliſh territories, S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> byſhop and abbot, who with forty other Prieſts his companions all good children of bleſſed S. <hi>Bennet</hi> preached here ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, that upon one Chriſtmas day he baptiſed more then ten thouſand ſouls: for which good work of our converſion the Kingdom of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ever owned that good Pope for their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual patron and apoſtle. And the children of S. Bennet are indeed our very fathers who firſt begat us in Chriſt, and regenerated our Engliſh nation to the life of future bliſs.</p>
                  <p>This Chriſtian religion brought in by S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> the Brittons could not deny it to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable unto their own catholick faith recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved formerly from Pope <hi>Eleutherius</hi> in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of doctrin; although they were ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with paſſion againſt the Saxons their antient adverſaries, that they would neither let their own prieſts, whereof they had more ſtore then they had uſe of, go forth to their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; nor yet forbear to diſturb good S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:121335:114"/>in his ſo pious a work. But ſuch good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did our forefathers the <hi>Saxons</hi> after their converſion prove, that they yielded nothing to the antient Brittons before them, yea rather they exceeded them; ſo that all the land was ſtored by them with goodly monaſteries of S. Bennets order, brave cathedral Churches, fair colledges and libraries manuſcript, croſſes, ſhrines, oratories, ſufficient and wholſom laws for all occaſions, hoſpitals, corporations, and all that might be neceſſary either to our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral or ſpiritual welfar. And all our people were wholly attentive to their devout contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations of a life to com in Chriſt our great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, Church and State being now moſt piouſly and prudently provided for, when <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour</hi> in the year of our Lord 1066, <hi>Conſtantine Duca</hi> being Emperour of the Eaſt came in upon us from France and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered us.</p>
                  <p>This valiant captain finding our catholick religion conformable to his own Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, although he abrogated much of our ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil law, and uſed in temporal affairs too too much of violence, thereby to ſubjugate the land more perfectly to himſelf; yet he medled not at all with any alteration in religion, nor once excepted againſt it, but lived himſelf with the reſt of his ſubjects both ſaxes and normans and died contentedly therein, building of his
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:121335:115"/>own devotion ſom fair monaſteries to S. Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net before his death, wherein God might night and day be ſerved and praiſed, for his ſouls greater expiation from that tinctur of blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed it might have contracted in his wars and vehement proceedings with the ſaxon nobility after his victory. And in this ſame catholick religion did both Norman and Saxon live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably together and without any the leaſt diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance upon that account, though for civil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects York and Lancaſter raiſed broils enough, untill the end of King Henry the eighths reign, about ſix hundred years together after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours ingreſs into the land, the people of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering daily their prayers and oriſons before the altar and ſacred crucifix, together with their prieſts and prelats all Roman catholicks, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſchiſme or diſturbance.</p>
                  <p>From whence we may note, firſt, that all the three converſions of our Kingdom where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we lived unanimouſly ſo long together, were all of them to one and the ſame catholick Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man faith: ſecondly that this faith as it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents Chriſt its divine ſours in purity, which all men might ſee if they would have but patience to examine it, ſo likewiſe both in unity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeablenes: as there is but one God and he immutable, ſo is there but one faith and it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable. Thirdly that catholick religion is ſo far from being an enemy to the ſtate-politick,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:121335:115"/>as ſom reformers to its greater diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement would pretend, that it is the great founder and maintainer of it. Nor ever had this land for ſo many hundred years it was catholick upon the account of religion any diſturbance at all, whereas after the exile of that catholick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef in our land, from the period of K. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries reign to theſe dayes we have ever been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in actual diſquiet or at leaſt in fears; vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar heads uncontroulable in their fanſies, ſince they were by the reformation conſtituted in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect both judges and contrivers of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; ever raiſing ſom new fangled way or other to diſturb or at leaſt to threaten and indanger our peace. And it is a thing of much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that a nation ſuch as England is, ſo wiſe and ſerious in all other things, ſo judicious and grave, ſhould be perſwaded by any mans words againſt the dictamen of their own reaſon if they would but conſult it, to beleev any ſuch thing of this innocent faith, when they cannot but clearly ſee in all hiſtories both our own and others, that amongſt all the pretended wayes of Chriſtianity, only catholick religion both ſets up and preſervs the Crown, which giddy headed ſects indanger. Som of our engliſh clergy tell us of a thouſand I know not what dangers of the Pope, thereby to get the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſecular power to their own ends; but what is indeed the occaſion? they know aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:121335:116"/>that the Pope if he were once admitted would both ſeparate them from the ſecular life they lead, and bring into order their exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant opinions. And what harm if both theſe things were done? If we do but ſearch antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we ſhall find that none of our eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical benefices were given by princes and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to maintain a wife and children, but only ſuch ſingle abſtracted contemplative men as had conſecrated themſelvs and all their whole affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to God, to ſerv him in all ſinglenes of heart, in prayer and faſting and perfect charity and in the ſacrifice of the altar all the dayes of their life, without any ſolicitude after this world; as prieſts of antient Chriſtianity did: and not for women and children, unto whoſe generation againſt eccleſiaſtical cuſtom and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions our miniſters give as much attendance as any ſecular man whatſoever, and generate children which after their death unles they ſhow in their life time more of wordly ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude than their ſpiritual ſtate permits, muſt lie upon the pariſh: and as for ordering our diſſentions in points of faith I ſhould think not only the Pope who would aſſuredly do it, but any whatſoever thing in the world, though it were but an owl in an ivy buſh ſhould deſerv thanks if he effected it. But I return to my ſtory.</p>

                  <p>The Paſtour of Chriſtianity upon ſome ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation of Chriſtian Princes for a general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance throughout all Chriſtendom to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, ſent forth in the year 1517. a plenary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence throughout the world in favour of the <hi>Cruciata</hi> againſt the Turk. <hi>Albertus</hi> by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> delegated by the Pope to ſee it executed in Germany committed the preaching and promulgation of it unto the <hi>Dominican</hi> friars; which the hermits of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> within the ſame place took ill; but eſpecially <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Luther</hi> a preacher and profeſſour in that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:121335:117"/>eſteeming himſelf the beſt deſerving man in the town, grew exceeding wroth that any ſhould be choſen before himſelf, to execute that work which was likely to have as great an audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and confluence of people as might happen in a mans life time, to the no ſmall repute of him, who ſhould be thought worthy before an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to divulge the bull and make the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſermon, in the behalf as it were of the whole Chriſtian world. Vexed therfore that he was thus neglected and as he thought underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liewed, not only by words but books and papers ſecretly thrown about he diminiſhed firſt the dominicans, then the byſhop, then indulgences themſelvs. Catholick ſuperiours and princes bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this miſdemeanour of <hi>Luther</hi> as a practis of much danger and ſedition; but he grew not any thing better thereby, but rather more head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong and furious, as unlawful paſſion increaſes by the very means of mitigation, inveighing now with more boldneſs as far as he durſt, both againſt Prince and Prelate too. Inſomuch that the duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> after a year or two invited friar <hi>Luther</hi> to his court, where by diſpute and colloquy with the eminent doctour <hi>Eckius</hi> if he could not make his caus good, he might grow better principled, at leaſt for Gods ſake and his own good condeſcend to moderation and peace. But <hi>Luther</hi> after much tireſom talk told at laſt very boldly both the duke and his doctour too,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:121335:117"/>that the <hi>quarrel was not begun for God, nor for God ſhould it be ended.</hi> And ſo departing thence he proceeded now with more virulent words to incens the people, unto whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed liberty from their vowes and faſtings and other penitential obſervances; whereby he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted much of the laity, clergy and religious people both men and women, who, 'tis ſtrange to conſider it, violating their vowes deſerted that Catholick Church, beſides which they had never known nor heard of other, to follow the ſerpentine enticements of one private perſon; and he if not the worſt, yet at leaſt none of the beſt that ever were.</p>
                  <p>Thus when one ram has leapt over a hedg, all the other poor ſheep ſo many as be within ken of the fact are apt to follow. So prone is man to go aſtray like ſheep, and do amiſs to our own ruin without any other reaſon for it, than the ſight of a preſident acting before us what our own naturall inclination is apt of it ſelf without the curb of religion or law of its own natur to embrace. And ſo much was the world diſpoſed at that ill hour to a diſſolute looſnes, that <hi>Luther</hi> was ſtill gaining upon people even from his firſt apoſtacy: But when he had once married himſelf unto <hi>Catherine Bore</hi> a Nun by him ſeduced out of the monaſtery of <hi>Mymick</hi> contrary to both the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r vowes, ſo that he was now become a ſure and faſt enemy as well to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:121335:118"/>continence as before he had ſhown himſelf to abſtinence; 'tis wonder how faſt they flocked to him on all ſides, not only from the vulgar laiety, but even from all inſtutes and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and countries, even the prieſts and votaries of chaſtity, <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> a monk of S.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:121335:118"/>flew ſo ſwiftly about Europe like wild fire in dry ſtubble, that ere King <hi>Philip</hi> could get into Spain, his ſubjects there were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted many of them and hiſſing hot unto bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: but he was a wiſe prince and well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the unquiet genius of hereſie, and therfore took a ſpeedy cours with ſom for an enſample and terrour to the reſt, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his kingdom: but the wars in France were long and dangerous, thoſe of Germany and Holland hardly yet ended.</p>
                  <p>It was almoſt twelv years before this ſtrang confluence of people could agree together by what name to be owned till a chance gave it them thus: There was congregated, for the catholick Churches peace, a ſolemn diet at <hi>Spire</hi> in Germany; againſt which and the articles there agreed upon, <hi>Luthers</hi> new troop made a joint unanimous <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> appealing from the diet to the emperour, although their after comportment ſhewed that they did indeed no more reſpect the emperour than his diet, upon which general and hearty <hi>Proteſtation</hi> of their own, they were pleaſed ever after to call one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>Preteſtants.</hi> Yet ſooner than they had well agreed in the name they ſo much diſagreed in doctrine; ambitious heads, as all of them were, emulating each one as great a name and fame as <hi>Luther</hi> had, whom they both equalled in renown and place whilſt they all remained
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:121335:119"/>prieſts in the catholick Church, and now ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated injoyed as great fulnes of the ſpirit as himſelf; that they did not only ſet up ſeveral wayes and ſects amongſt themſelvs; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed and wrote bitterly one againſt another, even with more virulency than they had afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time uſed againſt the Church in the beginning of their diſceſſion: And now there was up and down amongſt the Proteſtants, here <hi>Oſianders</hi> church, there <hi>Stancars,</hi> there <hi>Melanchthons;</hi> here a body of rigid <hi>Lutherans,</hi> there ſoft ones, here <hi>Calviniſts</hi> enemies to both: here <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> there <hi>Valentine-gentiliſts:</hi> here <hi>Plenilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> there <hi>Semilutherans,</hi> there <hi>Antiluthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans:</hi> here the diſciples of <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> there of <hi>Suinglius,</hi> &amp;c. all which did ſo eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quarrel about the matters of Reformation, that a ſober man could not have the patience ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hear their ſermons or read their books.</p>
                  <p>Since that firſt diviſion of <hi>Luther,</hi> which is now above a hundred years, there have been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times both in Germany and other places many great meetings by Proteſtant divines of all ſorts and ſides, to bring all parties to an union; but it could never be effected to this day: which is a ſhrewd ſign, as <hi>Luther</hi> ſpake ingenuouſly before the duke of Saxony, that the concertation was not begun for God, nor yet for God ſhall ever be ended.

To the end he might marry with her, he endeavoured a divorce from his good wife Queen <hi>Catharine,</hi> with whom he had lived ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably and peaceably twenty years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which with moſt earneſt importunity for ſix whole years together when he could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the <hi>Pope,</hi> he renounced him; and by the inſinuation of ſome Lutherans who by this time had crept into the land he made himſelf Pope and head of the Church within the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of England: and ſo he diſpenſed with himſelf, and made that divorce by his own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority which the Pope could not do with his, and married <hi>Anne:</hi> whom a while after by the ſame autority he divorced again, and cut off as King and Pope, both <hi>Anne</hi> from his bed and <hi>Annes</hi> head from her ſhoulders.</p>
                  <p>Upon this ſtrang act of the Kings declaring himſelf head of the Church never before known or heard of ſince Chriſtianity firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered England, for though Kings were ever honoured as nurſing fathers of the Church yet
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:121335:120"/>head of influence to this myſtical body of Chriſt is onely <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf, and head of government under him only that perſon who firſt begot us in Chriſt and in whom all the ſacred hierarchy ends, I ſay upon that ſtrang act of his both King <hi>Henry</hi> and his whole kingdom was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown at one blow and laid proſtrate under the feet of thoſe men whom he had ſo gloriouſly triumphed of late, and obtained thereby to the no ſmall ornament of his crown the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a new title: for now came flocking in out of Germany Geneva and the Netherlands whole ſwarms of reformers, as thick as graſhoppers, by whom in a ſmall time, the Kings countenance being now ſet againſt catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks who could never be brought to like of his divorce, the land was ſo univerſally corrupted, defaced and ſpoiled, that within few years all the goodly monaſteries, nunneries abbeyes and their Churches were utterly diſpeopled, pillaged and ruined: and millions of people of both ſexes, a ſad ſight to behold, who had ſerved God night and day in thoſe their angelical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements caſt forth into the wide world to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a ſecular worldly life, many of them in their feeble old age, when all their whole live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood was taken from them.</p>
                  <p>The prey indeed was very great, but it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>aurum Toloſanum,</hi> neither King nor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was ever the richer for it; general granaries,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:121335:121"/>as the monaſteries then were, making provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for all children to be born in the land, which was infinite eas both for rich and poor, even unto all eternity; but theſe once pillaged and deſtroyed, vaniſhing in particular mens hands like water through the fingers whereof nothing at all conſiderable is kept. Nay he that was before the richeſt and nobleſt king in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop; after this vaſt ſpoil which a man would think were enough to ſet up any Prince that was never ſo low, became ſo very poor before his death, that he was forced to make adulterate and leather-coin to ſupply his wants: and of all the great families that were enriched with that ſpoil, there is not one in twenty that keeps up his head at this day.</p>
                  <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> ſtopped this torrent for a while, but it burſt forth again in Queen <hi>Eliſabeths</hi> reign, who alſo found it ſo impetuous, that ſhe with all her ſubtle counſel could not tell how to wield or rule a people of ſo many heads and factions, as had then flown together in the land out of ſeveral nations, and endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the people every one to their own way of reformation as the onely pure one. Yet the Queen notwithſtanding being declared illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate in her fathers daies, thought it ſafer all things conſidered, to leav off her ancient reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in which ſhe had by catholick byſhops re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Crown, than to diſguſt the reſolute
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:121335:121"/>Proteſtants. All the difficulty was how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent even them, being ſo ſeverally, biaſſed that no one thing could do it. French Proteſtants the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> and <hi>Suinglians,</hi> were mo in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; but German Proteſtants of greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; and both theſe and thoſe ſo ſubdivided into parties as there appeared no hopes to pleas any one without the offence of all the reſt. She concluded therefore by the advice of her counſel, which ſaw a neceſſity of it, to recall epiſcopacy which had been now ſome years baniſhed, by whoſe awe and power the rabble might be brought to ſom order. And becaus the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick byſhops who were now all of them ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as remained alive impriſoned, would not be induced either by promis or threats to ordain her any, and Proteſtant byſhops there were none upon earth, ſhe appointed her own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines by her autority and power to create one another; which kind of ordination though it were not onely ridiculous to catholicks, but hateful alſo to the greater part of Proteſtants who in all their reformations that were ever yet made, jointly execrated epiſcopacy as the main badg of popery; yet the Queen provided by an Act that none upon pain of her diſpleaſure and further penalties ſhould laugh at it.</p>
                  <p>Thus was ſettled and Engliſh Proteſtant Church neither according to <hi>Luther, Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon, Calvin,</hi> or any of thoſe firſt Proteſtant teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:121335:122"/>much leſs the Roman catholick; and yet too a part of every thing, as it were on purpos to pleas all, at leaſt to ſtop their mouths. The name of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> we aſſumed from <hi>Luther</hi> as the moſt ancient and honourable of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; the doctrin for the moſt part from <hi>Calvin</hi> as moſt pure; and our epiſcopacy in imitation of the <hi>Catholick,</hi> as moſt ſafe: and ſo we were neither one nor the other, and yet in ſome ſens all. We pulled down altars which <hi>Luther</hi> kept up, and ſet up epiſcopacy which <hi>Luther</hi> pulled down. We joyned with <hi>Calvin</hi> in his doctrin, but not his government; we joyned with <hi>Catholicks</hi> in their form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but not in their doctrin. We caſt off the Prieſts <hi>albe</hi> and <hi>veſtment</hi> to pleas <hi>Calviniſts:</hi> we keep ſtill the <hi>ſurplice</hi> to comply with <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and a ſacrament or two in condeſcention to the <hi>Catholick</hi> who delivered them with the addition of more. Our miniſters mourned in black to imitate the Papiſt prieſts that were then only in repute; and yet they did it with a wife in their hand that <hi>Luther</hi> might not take exception; whether the wife were virgin or wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, to ſatisfie <hi>Calvin</hi> who without ſcruple of irregularity married a tailors widow. For <hi>Luthers</hi> ſake we defied the Pope; for <hi>Calvins</hi> ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we bore our ſelvs towards the King as if he were little concerned in ſpiritual affairs; and yet to affront the <hi>Catholicks</hi> we called him head
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:121335:122"/>of our Church. We preached the word becaus <hi>Catholicks</hi> amongſt other things uſed to do it; we made no ſacrifice becaus <hi>Calvin</hi> abhorred it, and yet we kneeled in communion becaus <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> liked it. The maſs we caſhiered to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie <hi>Calvin,</hi> for <hi>Luthers</hi> ſake we drew a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious Common-prayer book out of it and the breviary, and to content the <hi>Catholicks</hi> we kept all the goſpel entire. The real preſence with <hi>Calvin</hi> we cried down, yet we kept an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar-table covered with linnen in ſome compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to <hi>Luther,</hi> and we bowed our knee as we paſt by, though it were a meer naked board, in imitation of <hi>Catholicks</hi> who uſed to do ſo to their inſhrined Meſſias. We kept up the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, that <hi>Catholicks</hi> who built them for that uſe might not except againſt us for pulling down all; we removed the altar-table to pleas <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> and inſtead of the crucifix upon the rood loft we placed a naked unicorn to content <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Catharin Bore.</hi> To affront <hi>Catholicks</hi> we preached down good works and charity, we cried up faith for <hi>Luthers</hi> ſake, and hope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus we could not ſee how it could ſtand with <hi>Calvins</hi> certainty of ſalvation we left to his diſpoſal, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>I Cannot ſee why a wiſe counſel and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may not with as much autority form
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:121335:123"/>a Church both for doctrin and government as either <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin;</hi> their judgments are moe in number, more verſed in weighty affairs, more clear and free from that paſſion which tranſported thoſe good birds to their reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this mixture of things by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of ſo many grave men, if a Church as well as other polities be of human inſtitution, is ſo far from derogating that it augments the ſplendour. I am ſure this Church of ours marched forward with a very handſome ſhow and ſome tranquility of progreſs even until the reign of our good King <hi>Charls</hi> the firſt, when it was with a violent wild rage miſerably defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. In all which time of its flouriſh the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Catholick was with all exact care per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted all the land over both in their livelihood and dignities and liberty and ſomtimes life too; although their impriſonments and loſs of their eſtates did not ſo much afflict them as two other vexations, the one to their fame the other to conſcience, both of them unto good and upright men almoſt inſupportable. For the preſs and pulpit were ever ſweating out ſomthing againſt the honour of Roman catholicks, which hath rendered them at length as black as ingenious calumny can make them. The conſcience tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was a double edged Oath drawn on purpos to entangle thoſe catholicks whom threats pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, or promiſes could not move to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:121335:123"/>their former way of faith: and it could not but take; for going under the ſpecious name of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and withall implicitely involving, as the letter ſounded, an abnegation of ancient Chriſtianity, it would if they refuſed them render Catholicks extreamly odious to their neighbours, and perjured if they took them. And here I cannot but commend the conſcientiouſnes of Pagan emperors our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient perſecutors, who though they ceaſed not to deprive the poor Chriſtians of their digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſtate and lives, yet did they never offer them an oath concerning religion, which they knew beforehand to be againſt the articles of their beleef, thoſe great heroes knowing full well, that as perjury is a deviation from the right reaſon of humanity, ſo can it be no other to drive any one upon it. Nay emperour <hi>Julian,</hi> ſirnamed Apoſtate, openly proteſted in one of his epiſtles, that he would have no manner of violence offered to the conſcience of the Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. I know that to pacify the Puritans who except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as highly as any catholick againſt them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though upon other grounds, the Oaths were by roial interpretation both of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> much mollified; but that their
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:121335:124"/>expoſition was private, incompleat, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to Catholicks, and which the words as they ſounded would hardly and very hardly bear.</p>
                  <p>However catholicks as they did ever offer themſelvs to take any oath of allegiance which were purely ſuch, and involved not an abnega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their antient Chriſtianity, ſo likewiſe have they ever ſhewed in deed and fact, that they would keep the allegiance tho they took not the oath, whereas others took the oath and broke the allegiance. And which of theſe two is moſt honeſt and Chriſtian like our B. Saviour has in the like caſe long agoe decided. <hi>A certain man ſaid he, had two ſons, and coming to the former he ſaid, ſon go to day and work in my vineyard, and he anſwering ſaid, I will not, but after repenting himſelf he did it. Now coming to the other he ſaid in the like manner, but he anſwering ſaid, I go my Lord: and went not. Which of the two did the will of his father. They ſaid unto him, the firſt: Jeſus ſaid unto them; Amen, I ſay unto you that publicans and harlots ſhall go before you into the kingdom of God:</hi> the reaſon of this application is, becaus the Jew had entered an oath or covenant with God, but did contrary; the publicans took no ſuch oath, but yet when time ſerved fulfilled it.</p>
                  <p>But whiles we thus armed our ſelvs againſt the Roman catholicks, the diſguſted part of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:121335:124"/>who deeply diſliked this new epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whereby they might be as much curbed as by the catholick one before, did multiply amain; and were oftentimes ready to make head both in the dayes of queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and king <hi>James;</hi> inſomuch that the byſhops and ſtate were often in great perplexity, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſeek what they were beſt to do; if they ſhould favour the puritan, ſo the antepiſcopal proteſtant began then to be called, or let them alone, they would increas unto publick danger; if they ſhould reſiſt them, as it could not be done without ſcandal and hazzard, ſo neither could they tell how plauſibly to effect it, either by word or ſword: for this, there was no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient colour; for that no reaſon: ſith they did but only preſs home the firſt principles of reformation; which if they were fals, by what right was the Roman catholick ſo perſecuted and undon; if true, why ſhould engliſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant-epiſcopacy againſt thoſe principles be permitted to ſtand.</p>
                  <p>Yet at length our ſtate concluded ſtill pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to perſecute the Catholick, thereby to give ſome little content to the Puritan, and private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with all vigilant care to ſuppreſs the puritan, thereby to be more inabled to maintain our ſelves againſt the Catholick whoſe ſtate and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities we had entered upon. And our Engliſh byſhops they choſe rather to ſide with their
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:121335:125"/>younger foe the Puritan, than with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick their elder antagoniſt: becaus unto him in ſo doing they might ſeem free benefactours, to the other but juſt reſtorers of their due: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the novel levity of the Puritan could not, if it were a little countenanced or connived at, in any probability do ſo much prejudice to our prelate-proteſtant, as would the antient renown of Catholicks, if the religion ſhould com again into favour with that land that had not yet ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forgot its former glory. And although the danger to protestancy might be equal on both ſides if the power were alike, yet the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick would with a more uncontroulable ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice enter upon his own means and dignities of which he had been deprived by violence, than could the puritan invade anothers which yet he never had; although indeed he might pretend as much right to undermine the new eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed proteſtant-epiſcopacy, as proteſtants the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient catholick faith and clergy; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in truth it ſignified no right at all, yet <hi>ad hominem</hi> it was good enough: and the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan if he did it muſt be juſtified, or the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant if he judged him muſt condemn himſelf.</p>
                  <p>In the interim theſe waters of puritanisme increaſed and ſwelled ſo high, that about three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years after this our engliſh reformation, they brake out into effect in the reign of good K. Charls the firſt and overflowed all: and the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:121335:125"/>of theſe twenty years civil wars, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the rage of ſword bore down all before it, is not yet out of our minds. Whence we may ſee how vain the policies and conſultations of men, ſometimes be; God ſits in heaven and laughs at them. Our favouring of the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, which we choſe for our ſafety when we ſtudied the Catholicks overthrow, hath brought upon us a ſpeedy ruin. And yet we are ſtill but where we were, and in the like fears of that generation which knows not the things of peace; whereas the grave and ſober Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick if he had been countenanced, had by this time morally ſpeaking much innobled and ſtrengthened the land, and reduced it to the former ſplendour it had in antient times.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the puritan had got the victory and overthrown both our eccleſiaſtick and civil ſtate, he fell himſelf into many ſubdiviſions of <hi>presbyterian, anabaptiſt</hi> and <hi>quaker,</hi> which ſtruggled and conteſted one with another not only in pulpits towns and cities of the land, but in our parliaments too, thoſe very parliaments that had overthrown popery, as they called it, namely our proteſtant religion and monarchy; with the few Roman catholicks that were in the land, when they had once ſubdued all to their-will: And how zealouſly every one of theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſes his own way to the diſparagement of all others: what biting books and ſermons are
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:121335:126"/>darted forth by this latter progeny againſt one another as well as againſt the papiſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant is ſo evident I need not ſpeak it. The <hi>Puritan</hi> ſeems now to have yielded up his place and title, this his great battle being ended, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the new and later off-ſpring of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Independent;</hi> who are now grown old enough to begin a new battle and ſight, if they want a common adverſary, with one another: for all the brood is able and ſtrong enough at ten years old to go forth to battle, which will ſtill be renewed ſo long as hereſies are ſuffered to ſport and ſpawn: they only ſtay ſo long, that their number may ſufficiently increas; for as for every individual perſon he is furniſhed ſtrong enough in his very firſt being to skirmiſh, and comes forth even out of the womb with an alarm and open defiance; as the progeny, that roſe out of Cadmus his ſerpents teeth that were ſowen in the earth, came up all of them with nodding creſts and ſhaking ſpears, and as ſoon as they got their foot above ground fell a fighting.</p>
                  <p>And this is the ſtate of things in our king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom when lo moſt happily returns our glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſon to diſſipate theſe miſts King <hi>Charls</hi> the ſecond to his own home, after his too too long abſence and retirement from the hands of our violent rage; whom God inſpire and ſtrengthen that he may be able, if poſſibly it may be, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:121335:126"/>to his own hearts deſire to pacify, quiet, and content us all. But this I am ſure can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be done, had he ten times the wiſdom of <hi>Salomon</hi> and the excellency of all the worthies of the world couched up together in his prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breaſt (and his own worth is reported with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any help of other title to deſerv an empire) whiles we deſire contradictory things, and will not reſt if we have them not, nor yet will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto his autority and reaſon who ſtudies only our good, and makes uſe of all the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the land to effect it. Let there be but only two men whereof the one will have ſerene weather, the other rain in one and the ſame time and place, and I do not ſee how God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf except he chang their minds can pleas them both.</p>
                  <p>By this narration we may ſee when theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions about religion came firſt into England, what fruits they have had, how they have grown and increaſed, and what to judg of books and ſermons that caſt ſo much <hi>odium</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another: It is very brief indeed conſidering the amplitude of the matter, but I only intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſet it before my countrimen as a ſmall plate of anchovies or cavearr to ſharpen the appetite unto a further inqueſt after truth, which all theſe ſeveral wayes pretend to exhibit.</p>
                  <p>And if my reader be cautious he may eaſily
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:121335:127"/>diſcern a reaſon, why all theſe ſects are ſo boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous one againſt another; and every one of them againſt the Roman catholick. <hi>Iſmael</hi> diſturbed the whole hous, and was ever quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling and buſtling againſt <hi>Iſaac:</hi> The reaſon is the ſame both here and there. <hi>Iſmael</hi> was a natural ſon, and <hi>Iſaac</hi> the legitimate heir: and natural ſons be generally ſeditious, violent and clamorous. As <hi>Iſmael</hi> therefor was <hi>Iſaack</hi> his natural brother, ſo is a proteſtant miniſter but the bi-blow of a legitimate catholick prieſt: the Presbyterian likewiſe to him: and ſo forward, till you come to the Quaker, who was begot by a deluſion and brought into the world by a fright; his hand is againſt every man and every mans hand againſt him. The remedy and only means of peace is <hi>Ejice ancillam cum puero ſuo.</hi>

                  <p>IT may by what I have ſaid without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argumentation appear ſufficiently, that all anticatholick wayes are equally innocent. But it will not yet be ſo clearly acknowledged that the catholick alſo is abſolutely unblamable, except I wipe off ſom few ſpots and blemiſhes which we conceiv all of us to be in that religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eſpecially the vulgar groſs ones about maſs,

I could not even then but weep of times to ſee my father ſigh ſo frequently and deeply, which yet he ſeemed to do in great fear and ſecreſy, as I even then diſcerned; nor did I
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:121335:128"/>ever ſpeak word of it all my life, till now after forty years that I find my ſelf paſt either hopes or fear of many thing in this world. But I could not tell all the while of my youth whether I ſhould be angry at Popery or thoſe that perſecuted it: although I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I had a tender reſpect for it, when I heard my father ſay, <hi>People were better in Popery than we be now,</hi> yet ſtill he added with a ſigh in the cloſe, <hi>I know not what to think of it.</hi>

                  <p>But by this means I contracted a kind of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual reſolv, to find out if I lived what this <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> might be; which although troubles of ſchool and childiſh ſports covered for ſome years, yet at length it came upon me again ſo freſh and vigorous, that it ever and anon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred unto me. About eighteen years of age I lived in the Univerſity of Cambridg, where being one time deſirous to ask my good tutour who was my mothers kinſman, to ſhow me the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the hous; one of my fellow pupils wiſhed me not to do it, for that he had already told him, that none were to look upon them but only the ſeniours, and that it was expulſion for any els to read them; becaus there was in them much of Popery about confeſſion, maſs, praying at altars for the ſouls of deceaſed founders and benefactors of the colledg: unto all which I replied not a word. The greateſt benefit I got in the Univerſity was by looking
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:121335:128"/>over the heads and general contents of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great volumes I there met with in ſeverall fair libraries: for though I was not able then any further to mannage or make uſe of them, yet they ſtood me in ſtead afterwards when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon what I had there ſeen, I diſcerned that all thoſe great volumes of learning were, ſo many as were Chriſtian either latin or greek, all catholick writers.</p>
                  <p>After two years, wherein I had learned ſome few terms of logick out of <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>John Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> I left the Univerſity and came up to <hi>London</hi> where I met with Churches and ſermons good ſtore. Therein I obſerved three things I could not tell what to think of:
<list>
                        <item>Firſt that both in the Churches of the city and univerſity and countrey, whatever the text might be, ſtill pope and popery was brought in.</item>
                        <item>Secondly that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any good thing was ſaid of it, but all evil.</item>
                        <item>Thirdly that contradictory opinions and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were generally put upon that way: and yet our miniſters who could not but ſee it, did not ſo much as regard it at all; but equally flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed all of them in whatever they ſaid againſt it without the diſlike or check of any, or ſo much as the exception of him who had ſpoke of it aforetime even contrary things in the ſame place.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Popery thought I be ſo bad, let it paſſe: what a Gods name ſhould we talk ſo much of a
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:121335:129"/>thing that is paſt and gone, and buried with my grandfather, and no man ſees or is like to be troubled with it any more. How coms this nois ſo frequent in all places about a poor buſines, as if it were don by deſign of defamation? Are our miniſters afraid we ſhould turn Papiſts, who know not but by their report what Papiſt means, nor can no more underſtand what they be, than we can tell what complexion <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was of. We know this way is every where ſpoken againſt, and much evil is ſaid of it, but that has been don afore now to the beſt things; and a general decrying defamation ſeems rather a conſpiracy of intereſt than any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved reproach. And to what purpos, ſince it is dead and gon, ſhould we ſpeak of it at all; much leſs evil, and ſo much evil too. We ought to ſpeak well of the dead, at leaſt not ill; for dead men do not bite and ghoſts afright none but babes: and to ſpeak ill of another, as it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a fear we have they may be able to hurt us, and a deſire by our defamation to diſable them from ſo doing, ſo doth it fill our hearts with rancour, which if the party be dead is wholy uſeles.</p>
                  <p>But it is a ſtrang thing that popery or any religion upon earth ſhould be ſuch a fardell of trumpery ſin and villany, without any good at all in it. Such a thing one would think were impoſſible to be found. And it is yet more
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:121335:129"/>ſtrang that noble perſons ſhould voluntarily loſe their eſtates, honours, dignities in court, and eſteem among their neighbours, who were it not for that, obſtacle would dearly love them, and ſomtimes their lives too, for a thing hath no goodnes at all in it. The old Pagan religion contained in it many good things, but this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery is a hous of <hi>Judas</hi> all ſtench and rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: for our miniſters and the word of God muſt be beleeved.</p>
                  <p>And yet again, let Popery be what it will, if it ſignifie any one religion. it is the ſtrangeſt thing in the world it ſhould be evil in both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams that be contradictory and exclude one another. Miniſters ſpeak ill of it, that may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily paſs; and the higheſt ill, I cannot gainſay it: yea and nothing but ill, they may have a reaſon for it. But contradictory ills and ſo many of them and ſo tangible apparent ones 'tis a wonder of wonders that one and the ſame faith and profeſſion ſhould be able to exhibite. And yet I have never heard, let a miniſter ſay what he will againſt popery, that the byſhop ever calls him to an account for it: as it is don in other things even of leſs importance, inſomuch that <hi>Prynnes</hi> book againſt ſtage-plaies is now queſtioned. Againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> and only <hi>Popery</hi> all goes currant. No man if he ſpeak but ill enough, can ſpeak amiſs of it: and only here two evil extreams are not oppoſite.</p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:121335:130"/>
                  <p>One preacher ſaies that the Papiſts worſhip ſtocks and ſtones to which they are ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly addicted night and day; another, that all their religion is to worſhip a piece of bread. One, that their conſciences are ſo daily tortured and afrighted with the fire of purgatory and doomſday and pennances for their ſins, that they never have quiet life; another, that they carry their top and top gallant ſo high, that they will go to heaven without Chriſt, and get eternall glory of themſelves without any god-a mercy to him. One, that murders, adulteries, lies, blaſphemies and all ſin make up the bulk of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery; another, that papiſts are ſo wholly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to good works, that they place in them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive confidence. One, that the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and all his papiſts fall down to pictures and commit idolatry with them; another that the Pope is ſo far from falling down to any thing, that he exalts himſelf above all that is called God, and is very Antichriſt himſelf: He that hates and would deſtroy my perſon will not ſurely worſhip my picture. One, that they wallow without any conſcience or fear of God in their exceſſes; another, that they nothing but torture their carcaſſes with diſciplines and faſtings, as if men could not go to heaven in a whole skin. One, that in reſpect of chaſtity they villifie matrimony which the apoſtle calls honourable; another that by a ſupereſteem of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:121335:130"/>their own they make matrimony a ſacrament, thereby equalling it with baptiſme. One, that the ignorance of papiſt prieſts is ſo groſs and palpable that generally they can hardly read latine: another that the little ones which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the goſpel had by their ſimplicity prevailed over all the vaſt learning of the ſubtil popiſh clergy. One, that popery began in the twelfth age of the Church; another in the ninth; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in the ſixt; another in the fourth; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in the very primitive times of the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſstles: I cannot now call to minde the number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les contradictories I obſerved put upon the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts. Nor could I ever determine of my grand Sires religion by ſuch reports.</p>
                  <p>Wherefor after a year or two I put my ſelf to travel, all alone and ſolitary, to make my long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended diſcovery. Humanſy ſpeaking, it was raſhly done of me, and I ſeveral times thought ſo when I met afterwards with troubles I did not then foreſee, that were even ready to ſink me. For in all my ſufferings which were many and frequent, I could not but think of my many dear friends whoſe weeping tears in that my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour I had neglected. I beleev to this honour that ſomthing went before me to provide my enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and provoke people againſtime for coming to ſpy the land: for as loon as I ſet my foot on the other ſhore and ever ſince, afflictions have ſtill accompanied me. Nor yet was I ever
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:121335:131"/>ſo much offended with any mans abuſe, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for to think ill of the religion which I knew him to tranſgreſs. It is not to be expected that all the men of a kingdom ſhould equally imbibe the religion of the place. It may well be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, if only one in four follow pure ſenſual nature as they received it, from the womb, even amongſt the beſt profeſſions. Religion is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded to nature as ſalt, and is ſeveral wayes imbibed by men. Som drink it in as water, and with a little labour are quite concorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with it, and make as it were one body with the ſpirit thereof: ſuch were the glorious ſaints of the Church. Som take it in as pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered beef or other fleſh, unto a perfect ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning: yet ſo as that ſtill the fleſh is more, and hath the denomination: theſe are upright good men preſerved by the power of their religion from putrefaction and unſavorines, although they be men ſtill, upright men. Som take it in as clay in a leſs degree and more imperfect mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but yet they ſhew it in their lives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, for it keeps them together, and if in one action they miſs of grace in another they recover it. But ſom again in the fourth place are like a marble ſtone or brick which rubbed over with ſalt imbibes nothing: and ſuch as theſe have the name of religion upon them, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them; and they may be met with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, eſpecially in outward ſociety and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:121335:131"/>commerce, for they are ſtill abroad, even when better people are retired: and ſometimes they will for their own intereſt get into incloſures too, where they procure much diſturbance and vexation to the ſaints. In a word catholick religion is wondrous good and fruitful, as it was ſaid of Canaan, and brings forth huge cluſters of lovely grapes all over the land, but there be alſo giants and the ſons of <hi>Anak</hi> to be met with there, and I eſcaped not their hands.</p>
                  <p>But God knew the innocence of my heart, and I beleev his good angel ſupported me. For the main, I got the end I went for: and having paſſed through ſome part of Holland and Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many France and Flanders returned to my countrey, to participate of the miſeries which our civil wars then commenced upon pretens of a purer reformation and further elongation from popery, did bring upon us. And out of the love I bear my proteſtant countrimen I ſet forth this little <hi>Light,</hi> that they may no more be inveigled to infect their hearts and hands with the hatred and ruin of the innocent. For ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick faith, which we call popery, is in it ſelf a moſt ſacred and pure religion: it makes million of ſaints, though it permit ſome bad ones; even as proteſtancy, which brings all things to a naked beleef that muſt ſuffice what ever life we lead, though it ſuffer ſome honeſt men not apt by the light of reaſon to tranſgreſs
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:121335:132"/>ſo oft as they may, makes a million of loos and wicked ones: but this is the difference, that there the few evil ones have ſom remors for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill, here the multitude of deſperadoes have none at all. Catholicks cannot doubt of their faith, if Chriſt who promiſed to be with his Church unto the worlds conſummation, be a true prophet: and again if he be a true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, then all reformers who jointly affirm the Church to have failed for ſo many ages, muſt needs be in an errour. But I com to my travels and particular obſervations, ſo much as may ſerv to my preſent purpos.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="22" type="part">
                  <head>§. 22. <hi>Meſſach.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I Was edified and amazed to ſee catholick people flocking to Church not upon ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies only but every day in the week to their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred oriſons, the bells ringing to that purpos all the town over, not only every ſeveral hower in the morning until midday, but at verſpers compline, and even at midnight mattens when all the religious of a kingdom are called up in the very depth of their ſleep to chant forth pſalms hymnes and canticles to the prais and glory of the almighty. It deighted me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Churches which be kept ſo ſweet and clean and in ſuch a religious quiet retirednes,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:121335:132"/>that it would make a man at his entrance into them, as they ſay of the kingdom of <hi>Florida</hi> in a ſweet ſpring day, to forget wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and all worldly buſines. But when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the deep reverence and earneſt devotion of the people, the majeſty of their ſervice, the gravity of their altars, the decency of their prieſts; <hi>certainly,</hi> ſaid I within my ſelf, <hi>this is he hous of God and gate of heaven:</hi> Alas, our Churches in England as they be now, be as ſhort of thoſe either for decency, uſe, or piety, as ſtables to a princely pallace: there they be upon their knees all the week long at their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, many of then conſtantly an hour together in the morning, and half an hour he that is leaſt, and my hous ſaith God is the hous of prayer; but our Churches are either ſhut up all the week, or if they be open, are wholly taken up with boies ſhouting running and gamboling all about. On Sundaies indeed our people ſit quiet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently dreſt; but to bow the knee is quite out of faſhion; and if any one chance to do it, as he is rare to behold, ſo is he very nimble at it, and as ſoon up as down, as if he made a court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with his knees, or only tried if his nerves and ſinews were as good to bow as ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. And our whole religious work here, is to ſit quietly whiles a miniſter ſpeaks upon a text, conferring notes, anſwering difficulties, expounding words, drawing concluſions, and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:121335:133"/>putting together for ampler dilucidation one text to another; as if he were reading to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in the ſchool ſome piece of <hi>Ariſtotles Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rihermenias.</hi> And thus we ſpend all our daies ever learning and teaching, and our whole reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is to teach and learn, as if religion were only to lend the ear to one who cries <hi>Hearkens;</hi> or an art of knowing how to ſpeak an hour upon two or three words of a vers; which for my part as I am well enough aſſured that it is not the great work of Chriſtian religion, ſo neither is it the true work of Chriſtian preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; whether we conſult reaſon or preſidents of antiquity to find it. For as all ſermons left us by greek and latine fathers are grave ſhort and pithy, ſuch namely as they being all prieſts uſed to deliver at the altar between the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gile and Creed; ſo were they ever moſt free from any ſuch verbal comparing of text with text, vers with vers, and the like various vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which ſo take up our Engliſh preachings, that our ſermons be little or nothing elſe, and only ſerv to ſpend time and vent our own fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous verboſity.</p>
                  <p>If it do happen that a more learned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant do make a ſermon of ſolid matter, as ſometimes they will, he will be ſure before he make an end by one conceit or other to have a fling at the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to the end that people may think, as indeed they do, that Papiſts have no
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:121335:133"/>ſuch doctrine, though the preacher know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he got it all out of their books; which is a pretty piece of legerdemain, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequent in this land. Another thing I have obſerved, and it is worth obſervation, that of all the ſermons I have ever heard in England, I have never known any to deliver <hi>ex propoſito</hi> the proper and peculiar doctrin of proteſtancy, by which and for which we firſt revolted from the catholick Church; as that our good works be all mortal ſins and damnable before God; that we have no will or power to do good or avoid evil; that the commandements of God are impoſſible to be kept, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but rather all contrary; as if we were aſhmed of our own doctrin, and afraid to ſpeak before the people what we know in reaſon could not but offend Chriſtian ears: But all generally do preach, when they preach any good thing, the doctrin of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks; though ever abuſed with their own modes and mixtures. For every ſect as it hath a peculiar ſpirit, ſo hath it a mode and vein and method proper to it ſelf. The <hi>Independent</hi> ſpeaks many good words, but inconſequent and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, ſo much roving up and down as if he had a mind to be prophet errant, and before he gives over, to ſay ſomthing of every thing. The <hi>Presbyterian</hi> ever purſues ſome Platonick idea, for example, the ingoing and outgoings of Chriſt, which is ſo thin and bodiles, that he
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:121335:134"/>is forced to aſſign ſix or ſeven wayes to diſcern it; then gives twelv conſequent effects; nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen wayes to get, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which wayes he does even tire himſelf, as you may perceive by his melting and breathing when he comes to the high hills of <hi>eighteenthly</hi> and <hi>ninteenthly:</hi> and after ſome months labour and travel in theſe his wayes, at laſt with much ado he finiſhes his text; which before he handled it was good and eaſy doctrin, but is now by his tedious exerciſe rendered obſcure intricate and full of doubts. The <hi>Proteſtant</hi> cuts his text out logically into ſo many parts, and then walks through them all with an even rhetorick, adorned with witty conceits and flowers of common places, ſtill bringing un that parcel of the text he is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with ſuch proportion and meaſure in the cloſe, that a man muſt needs ſay when he has done, that he has ſhewed a featous piece of art: and when his, or Preſbyterian or Independents ſermon is ended, then is the great work of their religion done; though all to little purpos, for a dead mans foot, ſay what you will to him, will never warm is ſhoo.</p>
                  <p>But the Catholick, if he ſpeak like himſelf, having gravely and pithily preſt the intention of the goſpel for ſuch a day unto the peoples practis and devotion, falls to the great works of ſacrifice if it be in the morning, and of even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſong in the after noon, adoration, prayer and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:121335:134"/>charity; which is the ſumme wherein his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion conſiſts; and all his preaching ſervs but as a pair of bellows to make thoſe coles burn. Nor does any good old catholick, that is well grounded in the conſtant practis of his faith, care at all for any further inſtruction; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aforehand that it can tend to nothing els than what before he knew and yet endeavours to practis. For with him pure religion and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled is not to hear words but do deeds, to reliev the orphan and widow, and to keep our ſelvs unſpotted in this world; which unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tednes we attain by complying heart and hand unto the rule and ſacraments of <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt. Nor did the primitive Chriſtians for three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, ever hear any ſermon made to them upon a text all their whole life time, but meerly flocked together at their prieſts appointment, to their <hi>meſſach,</hi> or <hi>dominicum,</hi> or <hi>Leiturgy,</hi> or by what other name, for they uſed many at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times to avoid the pagans diſcovery, their Chriſtian ſacrifice was called. And it is moſt ſtrang that we ſhould pretend here in England to be Chriſtians and the only good ones, and yet reject thoſe two great things which were by all Chriſtendom eſteemed in every age the very eſſences of Chriſtianity, the tribunal of abſolution and the great Legacy of <hi>Jeſus</hi> his body to his ſpous the Church; inſiſting wholly upon preaching which as it is an accidental and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:121335:135"/>relative work of our Chriſtianity, ſo is it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with us an all religions both Mahometan Jew and Pagan; whoſe ſermons if any ſhould hear he could not tell, by the morality of the maſter, to what religion they belonged.</p>
                  <p>It is hard to ſay, why againſt all the vogue of antiquity we ſhould be ſo violent as to aboliſh the Chriſtian ſacrifice, pull down the altars, baniſh the prieſthood, yea and perſecute it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, except we mean to repaganiſe our ſelvs. Our proteſtant forefathers when they firſt roſe, found manifeſtly all the Chriſtian world over, that this <hi>incruent ſacrifice</hi> according to the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was and had ever been the ſum of all apoſtolical devotion; for which our many goodly fair Churches, ſhrines and altars were built, which hang now forlorn and deſolate in our hands like great dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſes after the ſoul is departed: for the inſhrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed body of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the life and ſoul of our Churches, which then died all of them when he departed, mouldring away ever ſince into duſt and rottennes. And therefor <hi>Martin Luther</hi> with his <hi>Kate,</hi> the Adam and Eve of prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtancy, did not for that reaſon preſume to pull down the altars, although they would not keep them up without the mixtur of ſom errour of their own. But we in England in our ſtrang heat tore down all, without either preſident of the catholick world or our own reforming fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.</p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:121335:135"/>
                  <p>We cannot but ſee if indeed we ſee any thing, that every law and religion hath been ſtill an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed with a correſponding ſacrfice. Yea ſo ſurely and univerſally, that ſacrifice ſeems both to be born with religion and with religion to be extinguiſhed. The firſt men who worſhipped God in the world as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> are ſaid to have don it with a ſacrifice: after the flood with religion again renewed was alſo ſacrifice renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Noah;</hi> and when afterwards through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers perſecutions religion was brought into hazzard, nothing did the prophets ſo much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the ceaſing of their ſacrifice as may be be ſeen in the book of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Daniel.</hi> And not without reaſon; for all other kinds of good things offered or don to God are common alſo unto creatures; only ſacrifice is a worſhip ſo due to the Almighty, as none either in heaven or earth may partake with him in it: an other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice properly ſocalled beſides this according to the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> there never was any amongſt Chriſtians. For although faith, hope, and prais be by way of analogy called a ſacrifice, in an improper and tranſlated locution, to ſet forth the worth and acceptablenes of them; yet this is ſo far from derogating to the great and ſolemn ſacrifice properly ſo called, that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſes and eſtabliſhes it: for the other could not have that analogical name, except that thing were unto which they may bear analogy:
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:121335:136"/>prais could not be commanded as ſacrifice, if there were no ſuch thing as ſacrifice, thence the commendation ſhould be drawn, and to whoſe worth it ſhould allude: as it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and fooliſh, to expreſs the ſweetnes of any oratory by the name of honey and ſugred rhetorick, if we did beleev there were no ſuch thing as honey and ſugar in nature. It is true alſo that the death of Chriſt upon the croſs was both a true and ſolemn ſacrifice: but that is paſſed away and is the object of our faith, not an external rite about which the Church may meet and com together at all times to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, as is this repreſentation of it which our Lord inſtituted for that very end before his death. Nor is the paſſion of our Lord proper to us Chriſtians alone, as the real figuration of it which himſelf inſtituted; for all the ſacrifices of the old law were accepted in order to that paſſion to com, even as ours in reſpect of it now paſt.</p>
                  <p>And ſince there were true ſacrifices in the old law amongſt the Jews, why ſhould there not be alſo in the new which is beleeved to be more perfect; about which Chriſtians ſhould aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to offer up with it and it order to it all their requeſts and praiſes? For Chriſt our Lord took not away thoſe things which God his father in the old law inſtituted as being not contrary to him; but only perfected and changed them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:121335:136"/>better things, both precepts, ſacraments and ſacrifice too. and of this laſt it behooved him to be more careful then all the reſt; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſith ſacrifice is the only worſhip proper and peculiar unto God, by utterly taking it away, he had not augmented but dimiſhed his Fathers glory. All other kinds of worſhip we Chriſtians have for certain which the Jews ever had, invocation, adoration, vows, hymnes, feaſts, faſts, faith, hope, charity and prais; muſt only that which only is proper to the almighty be excluded? eſpecially ſith we have all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to honour God by ſacrifice the Jewes ever had: we are an extern and viſible congregation as they were; we have the paſſion of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias to be repreſetned before our eyes now with us paſt, as with them it was to com; we have the ſame God with the higheſt worſhip to be honoured, for our ſins to be appeaſed, for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to be invocated, for received benefits to be praiſed.</p>
                  <p>But if any will be contentious and not heed all this, which is nothing but pious reaſon, let him look upon the primitive Church in the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles time whereof we have ſome clear <hi>footſteps delivered us</hi> in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> and he ſhall find that the apoſtles and apoſtolical Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians placed their religion not in hearing or making ſermons, for they had none; but in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to their Chriſtian liturgy, and all anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:121335:137"/>will atteſt it. The ſermons mentioned in that book were only in defence of Chriſtianity, made to the Jews &amp; Pagans for their converſion, not to any Chriſtians at all: Such was St. <hi>Peters</hi> firſt ſpeech to the Jews and Gentiles that brake in amongſt the Chriſtians in Jeruſalem after their <hi>Meſſach</hi> ended, and the holy Ghoſt fallen upon them, c. 2. after this to other Jews, c. 3. c. 5. then to <hi>Cornelius</hi> a pagan c. 10. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſpake S. <hi>Stephen</hi> to the Hebrew Prieſts and Jews c. 7. Saint <hi>Philip</hi> to the Ethiopian Eunuch c. 8. St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the ſynagogue in <hi>Piſidia</hi> c. 13. to others in Iconium c. 14. to Gentiles in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia c. 16. again to other Jews in Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica and heathen Philoſophers in Athens c. 17. both S. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> to the Jews at Corinth and Epheſus c. 18. c. 19. at Troas alſo he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Chriſt and his religion againſt all that reſiſted it, ſpeaking even till midnight; c. 20. but this was diſpute, (and ſo the text calls it) rather than a preaching; and made <hi>una ſabbati,</hi> ſaith the ſame text, <hi>cum conveniſſemus ad frangen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum panem;</hi> ſo that it was not the work they came together for, but an additament to it. So likewiſe he ſpake to other Jews in Jeruſalem, c. 22. to <hi>Foelix</hi> and <hi>Agrippa</hi> painims c. 24. c. 26. to the Jews in Rome for their converſion c. 28. And no where was ever ſermon made to formal Chriſtians either by St. <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> or any other, as the work of their religion they came
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:121335:137"/>together for: nor be there other ſermons in that book but what I have mentioned; nor did the Chriſtians ever dream of ſerving God after their converſion by any ſuch means, but only by their Euchariſtian <hi>leiturgy,</hi> and <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> bread-fraction, or <hi>Meſſach,</hi> as is apparent in that book: I will mention but one place in the beginning of the 13. ch. which ſpeaks thus, <hi>Miniſtrantibus illis Domino &amp; jejunantibus dixit ſpiritus ſanctus, &amp;c.</hi> Whiles they were adminiſtring to our Lord and faſting, the holy Ghoſt ſaid, Separate me <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas;</hi>

And all that whole book teſtifies ſufficiently
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:121335:138"/>that the apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians ever came together to their <hi>Dominicum</hi> or <hi>Educhd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,</hi> to their <hi>liturgy</hi> or <hi>meſſach,</hi> and not to any ſermon; not <hi>ad audiendam concionem</hi> but <hi>ad frangendum panem.</hi>

                  <p>It would griev any Chriſtian heart to ſee the poor Catholicks of England ſo miſerably ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed, pillaged, impriſoned, hated, hanged by their own allies and countreymen, as they have been now a hundred years, for the profeſſion of that great work of Chriſtianity which Chriſt and his apoſtles taught them; and that they ſhould undergo the ſame diſgrace and ruin by ſuch as call themſelves Chriſtians, yea the only pure ones, for that very ſelf ſame act of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for which both the Apoſtles themſelves and all primitive Chriſtians were ſo cruelly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by Jew and Pagan. But the God of mercies look in his good time both upon the perſecutour and ſufferer, with compaſſion and favour; them, becaus they have done it igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly in incredulity, theſe becaus for his fear and love they have perſevered hitherto through many great afflictions in his ſervice, and patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withſtood all oppoſition even unto blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and death until this day: But Catholicks had their leſſion read them long ago, and they have it by heart by this time. <hi>They will,</hi> ſaith their Lord and maſter, <hi>lay their hands upon you and perſecute you, delivering you into cuſtody and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:121335:138"/>priſons, dragging you before Kings and preſidents for my names ſake; and ye ſhall be betraied by parents, children, kinsfolk and friends; and ſome of you they will put to death, and ye ſhall be a hatred unto all men for my name: but who ſhall perſever unto the end he ſhall be ſaved.</hi> But I hope our countreymen will at length diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern their own dangerous miſtake, and perceiv with me that the Popiſh <hi>Maſs</hi> which is the old opoſtolical devotion merits not the hatred and miſchief we have either wrought or intended the obſervers of it in our land.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto then I hope we have no reaſon to hate popery, upon the account of their <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſach;</hi> which is indeed the chiefeſt piece of our diviſion, and occaſion of the many contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies we put upon them; eſpecially conſidering that in our own Communion, ſo far as it goes, we do but imitate great part of it, and that in their very words.</p>

                  <p>AL Catholiks I could ever ſee or hear or read of, bear a moſt devout reſpect to the <hi>Virgin MARY,</hi> whom others care not how they vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify and diſhonour either by their words or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: and I cannot but diſlike this our uncivil carriage, to ſay no wors of it, as much as I do
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:121335:139"/>approve of their piety. Surely that <hi>Virgin</hi> of whom God would be incarnate, and with whom he lived ſo many years together, muſt needs be a perſon of ſtrang perfection, and worthy of great eſteem amongſt all ſuch as worſhip her <hi>Son</hi> and look upon him indeed as their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. He that loves him that begets, ſaith the good apoſtle, loves him that is begotten; and I ſhould think he that worſhips him that is begotten, muſt needs have ſome reſpect for her that bare him. The bleſſed <hi>Virgin</hi> was her ſelf ſo confident of this, that ſhe was bold to ſay, <hi>Ecce enim ex hoo beat am me dicent omnes gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationes,</hi> all generations, all nations, ſaith ſhe, ſhall call me Bleſſed. And ſurely if this be true, and in goſpel it paſſes for divine words, we that inſtead of calling her Bleſſed preſume ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to villify and blaſpheme her even in our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſtreets, for which in catholick countries we ſhould be in danger of being ſtoned to death by the people, ſhow our ſelvs to be a nation that belongs not to the <hi>Magnificat.</hi> Indeed all here amongſt us are not ſo rude; but ſuch as be, are neither puniſhed nor queſtioned for it. And what in the name of God hath the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> don to us, what ill or harm hath ſhe ever wrought us, that any Engliſh Chriſtian ſhould caſt ſo many gibes, and ſhow ſo much diſeſteem to that bleſſed creatur, whom the whole catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick world, the angels of heaven, nay our Lord

                  <p>Do not I know that the primitive prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in forreign parts have uttered, ſome openly, ſome more obſcurely, in their writings many odde words againſt the very honour of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, although our more moderate Church of England I am confident hates them for it. Did not <hi>Calvin</hi> taunt at his ignorance and paſſion and too much haſte for
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:121335:140"/>his breakfaſt: when he cruſt the figtree that had not fruit upon it when he ſought it? if he had ſtudied catholick divines they would have taught him a more modeſt and pious interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation than that idle wicked one of his own. Did not <hi>Michael Servetus</hi> that bold apoſtate Spaniſh youth ſpeak openly amongſt his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low proteſtants in <hi>Geneva,</hi> that he wondered that they had raiſed all their controverſies ſo many as they had againſt the Church which is named the body of Chriſt, and yet never a one againſt Chriſt the head of that body? did not <hi>Valentine Gentile</hi> that unhappy Italian, after he had revolted to <hi>Calvin</hi> take it ill that all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches agreed yet with the papiſts in the beleef of a Trinity? and with him ſided <hi>Matheus Gribaldus, Liſmanin, Francis David;</hi> and <hi>Jacobus Paleologus,</hi> though this laſt recant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed afterward and returned happily to his catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick faith. And who-knows not that <hi>Luther, Brentius, Calvin, Suinglius,</hi> yea and <hi>Eraſmus</hi> too, who though he yet remained catholick would be nibling now and then at Arrian and Socinianiſme, let fly many a ſecret dart at Chriſt and the ſacred Trinity? though they were not yet ſo bold as to profeſs openly with ſom others of their brethren, whom they ſaw to ſuffer in their repute for it, any ſuch opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; till they found the world in a more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſpoſition to accept it: and all theſe
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:121335:140"/>bent their bowes and fitted their arrowes to the ſtring, that if not openly yet at leaſt in the dark and in <hi>Lunâ,</hi> as the prophet phraſes it, they might ſhoot and hit every thing that is ſacred, even Chriſt himſelf. So true it is, that he who loves him that begets, loves him that is begotten, and he that hates the one does not truly love the other. But the penmen of our creed and goſpel who made ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable mention of the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> were of another ſpirit, than we be that ſo much diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour her, although for faſhion ſake we read over thoſe holy penmens words. A certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant byſhop did not many years ago examin a catholick child that ſtood before him if he could ſay his prayers; the boy replying yes, ſaid firſt his <hi>Pater noſter;</hi> after that began his <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> which catholicks uſe to repeat in memory of Chriſts incarnation; at which words, nay, quoth the byſhop <hi>let her alone, let her alone, we have nothing to do with her.</hi> The child went on to his Creed, and when he came to <hi>conceptus eſt de ſpiritus ſancto natus ex</hi> — he ſodainly ſtopt; and <hi>ſhe is here again,</hi> quoth the child, <hi>ſhe is here again my Lord, what ſhall I do with her now;</hi> you may let her paſs quoth the byſhop in your Creed but not in your prayers. As though we might have faith but neither hope nor charity for her. But if we ſeriouſly conſider the ſpirit of thoſe who wrote either
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:121335:141"/>our Goſpel or Creed, we ſhall find that of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man catholicks to have a moſt near conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with it, and loving them we cannot hate theſe for the reſpect they bear his virgin Mother whom we all worſhip.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>IN all places where I came I beheld great ſtore of pictures and images in Churches of Roman catholicks; which being in the poſtures either of their bloody martyrdoms which for their religion they underwent, or apoſtolical ſacrifice, or ſacred retirements, meditations, or other exerciſe of their faith hope or charity ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther towards God or their neighbours, apoſtles, martyrs, confeſſours, hermites, monks, virgins, kings, queens, byſhops, as they made a goodly ſhow, ſo did they mightily aſſiſt the fanſy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a more united thought of the religion peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple came into the Church to fulfil and ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe. But the altar is ſeldom without the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicts of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and his <hi>Virgin Mother,</hi> but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without the <hi>Crucifix:</hi> the ſight of all which is apt to caſt into the mind of ſuch as enter into the Church that meditation of the apoſtle in his epiſtle to the Hebrewes, <hi>Non acceſſiſtis ad tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctabilem montem &amp; accenſibilem ignem,</hi> &amp;c. Ye are not com to the high towring mount, flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:121335:141"/>fire and whirlwind; and darknes and ſtorm and ſound of trumpet, and nois of words, which they that heard excuſed themſelves, and requeſted to hear it no more, and it ſeemed ſo terrible that Moyſes himſelf ſtood trembling and affrighted; but ye are come to Mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the city of our living God, to celeſtiall Jeruſalem and ſociety of angels, the Church of primitive Chriſtians conſcript in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the ſpirits of juſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect men, to Jeſus the mediatour of a new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to the Aſperſion of blood ſpeaking better things than Able.</p>
                  <p>And all theſe repreſentations, ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to devotion and piety as they do, the doctrine and men who tore them down and caſt them out of our Engliſh Churches, and broke and hewed them in pieces with ſo much rage, could not be any friends whatever they might pretend, either to our mount Sion or the citty of our living God, the celeſtial Jeruſalem, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of angels, the Church of primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, or to the ſpirits of juſt men perfected, or to Jeſus mediatour of the new teſtament, or laſtly to the aſperſion of blood ſpeaking better things than Abel, all which was there pour-traited and deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>It is the judgment of all men that the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Image redounds to the Prototype; and therefore Kings not only in Chriſtendom,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:121335:142"/>but beyond it uſe to puniſh a grand traitour either deceaſed or fled even in his <hi>effigie.</hi> Every particular perſon loves to behold the picture of him he eſteems, and again if he hate the perſon he deteſts the face: thus even our late rebells here in England after they had murthered our good King, ſhot his pictures with bullets, and broke them with their cimiters and ſpears all the land over. <hi>Thy adverſaries</hi> ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>have roared</hi> and <hi>raged</hi> in the midſt of thy ſynagogues, and for <hi>thy enſigns</hi> have ſet up their own <hi>banners;</hi> as once of thoſe who with ſtrong exes cut up the thickeſt of <hi>timber</hi> unto the temples ſtructure it was eſteemed an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and noble work in them; ſo is it countd now if any on the contrary break in pieces <hi>thy ſculptures</hi> with axe &amp; hammers: they were Gods enemies then that did all this, and that brake down his ſculptures; and by thoſe very works of theirs concluded to be his enemies by a great Prophet, who well enough underſtood who was Gods friend and who his foe.</p>
                  <p>If any would conſider the conſtitution and exigence of mans nature he would ſoon find not only the convenience but neceſſity of ſuch helps as ocular repreſentations afford us: for the fanſy hath nothing but what it receives from the ſenſes, and the intellect works upon nothing but what it has from fanſy; and therfore did God make man in the laſt place after heaven
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:121335:142"/>and earth was framed, to the end that in ſo great a variety of ſenſible objects he might find ſomthing to think of even in the firſt inſtant of his being; wheras if he had been made before other things he had ſtood like a ſtock or ſtone without any poſſibility of a thought. Now nothing adminiſters to the fanſy and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the mind with that variety and life and power as doth the eye: the ſupplies of the ear care but dead things to it, eſpecially in the account of exciting deſire and love: let Cicero ſpeak a whole day upon the beauties of a prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeat, countrey, city, man or woman; yet when the eye comes once to ſee the thing in its own properties, it diſcerns and repreſents more at one glance than could his or all the oratory in the world ever by the help of the ear im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print into the mind. Indeed who is ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that he has not obſerved ere this; that the eye has a hundred fold the actuoſity of the ear: nor is it unknown what ſtrange melting affections are cauſed in the heart by a continual ſight and meditation of ſome ſacred pictur of the <hi>Crucifix;</hi> when ſermons float by and effect little or nothing in compariſon; even as world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly objects ſo long as they are coached in aiery words paſs away like wind, but once ſeated in the throne of the eye they move impetuouſly. Nor can all the miniſters in the world give me a reaſon why the eye in a ſacred purpos may not
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:121335:143"/>have the helps of her ſpecies, as well as the ear have hers; or why the minde that is to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and can never be moved too much in ſuch things may not as well have the quicker as duller aſſiſtance. For when any one preaches upon the Paſſion of Chriſt, does he do any thing els but labour to work out ſuch repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations in the ear and minde as oratory may effect, for the moving of affections cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding to ſuch an object: and if ſuch good meditations put into a book of devotion be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted with an ocular repreſentation which is more quick and full, and carries more of life with it, what harm is it! ſurely he that deprives me of the more lively helps, never means whatever he pretend, I ſhould have any cordial feeling of the things he talks of.</p>
                  <p>And verily the Proteſtant pretenſes for their removal of images out of our Churches are but ſimple ones, and the ſimpler they be the the better it ſeems they ſerve the deluded vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. Firſt ſay they <hi>God has in his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments forbidden the making of graven images:</hi> Good, and has he ſo? do you not find too that he commanded it? ſee if he did not give order in the ſame ſcripture for <hi>Cherubins</hi> and <hi>Seraphins</hi> to be made and ſet up in his <hi>ſanctum ſanctorum</hi> over the ark? what then, did God or Moſes forget himſelf, and contradict his own words? or are you blind? or only catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:121335:143"/>fools? or what is the matter. Look ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and you ſhall find that <hi>Moſes</hi> forbad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and forreign images, but he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own: though he diſliked the ugly face of <hi>Molech Dagon</hi> and <hi>Aſtaroth,</hi> yet did not he therefor will his people ſhould tear down his own <hi>Cherubins.</hi> And Chriſtians likewiſe have not any images of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> although they have St. <hi>Peters:</hi> the <hi>Crucifix</hi> they will keep and uſe and honour, not the portraict of <hi>Him</hi> with a cloven foot: if they eſteem the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and effigies of great <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> yet not of wicked <hi>Diocleſian;</hi> if we find in their Churches the image of bleſſed S. <hi>Bennet</hi> or good Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> yet ſhall we never meet there with the face of <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin:</hi> ſo that here in the catholick Church as well as in Moſes law is both, <hi>Thou ſhalt make graven images,</hi> and again <hi>Thou ſhalt not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much Anticatholicks might themſelvs underſtand, if they would conſider any thing ſeriouſly, by the very words of the text. <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven image:</hi> not make <hi>to thy ſelf.</hi> As if he had ſaid, when you com into the land amongſt the gentiles, let none of you be inveigled either by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or words, to make <hi>to himſelf</hi> any of the images he ſhall ſee there ſet up by the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, contrary to the ceremonies of Moſes and practis of the ſynagogue, which doth ſo honour
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:121335:144"/>her own Cherubins, that ſhe abominates all idols and their ſculptures. And thus if any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick ſhould make <hi>to himſelf</hi> and upon his own head and fanſy, contrary to what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, any peculiar image of the planets for example, or wicked men to worſhip it for ſacred, I beleeve he will be puniſhed for his tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. So that images are not forbidden in the general notion of images, but only of ſuch or ſuch a kind; as if I ſhould forbid my ſervant who travels with me into France and keeps my purs, to make <hi>unto himſelf</hi> any cloathes; I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not that he ſhall go naked, but only that he make no cloathes but what and when and in what faſhion I approve. Secondly they ſay, it is idolatry. But this is ſpoken without logick. Except the thing repreſented be an idol, devil, or ſomthing oppoſite to God, or below man, whom yet he will worſhip; the honour and uſe of the image cannot be idolatry. If I may reſpect and love the perſon. I may love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the image too; ſith this my eſteem is terminated ultimatly only upon the prototype. <hi>Moſes</hi> never feared idolatry with his own <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins,</hi> and yet he had as much reaſon to fear it as the Chriſtian Church can have. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of an image is but a natural reſultancy from the exemplar repreſented in it, and this can be no other affection but what is due to that: as any man may perceive by four ſeveral
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:121335:144"/>images ſet before him, the firſt of his king, the other of his father, a third of his ſweet-heart, a fourth of his mortal adverſary: upon the ſight of all which he conceivs and can conceiv no other but that paſſion he bears the proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type or thing reſembled, honour to one, duty to the other, tender love to the third, and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſaffection to the laſt. Now that the ſaints and angels of God, ſpirits aſſiſting to Gods glory and worſhip, and adminiſtring to our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities deſerv a veneration at our hands I ſhall ſpeak anon; and from the image can reſult no other but what is their due. As they be no Gods, ſo neither can their image make them ſo: the image of my enemy makes him not my ſweet heart, nor can the picture of my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour make him my king: And how can the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of Gods ſaints and ſervants make them otherwiſe than what they are. But all theſe petty arguments are taken from the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courous <hi>Jewes,</hi> who were never bent againſt images in general, till they ſaw the Chriſtians to keep and worſhip the figure of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> whom they all hated.</p>
                  <p>And if Proteſtants can love Jeſus Chriſt <hi>crucified</hi> and hate the repreſentation of his <hi>croſs,</hi> which two things how they can conſiſt together no reaſon of man can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; yet let us not maligne the <hi>innocent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> for doing that which the reaſon of all
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:121335:145"/>mankind allows. What perſon ſoever I may love, I may like his image alſo.</p>

                  <p>THe catholick liturgy is and ever was all over the weſtern empire in the latin tongue. This general cuſtom of keeping both maſs and bible in an unknown tongue from vulgar hands, as it may be made to carry with with it a plauſible ſurmiſe either of fraud or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy; ſo hath it been the great engine uſed by Proteſtants both to draw and keep a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people from the boſom of the catholick Church. The buſines of Scripture I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hinted at: For catholicks have the ſumm of ſcripture both for hiſtory and dogme deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them in their own language ſo much as may make for their ſalvation, good orders being ſet and inſtituted for their proficiency therein, and what needs any more? or why ſhould they be further permitted either to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy curioſity, or rais doubts, or to wreſt words and examples there recorded unto their own ruin, as we ſee now by experience men are apt to do. Beſides the book is ſacred and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for not to be ſullied with every hand. What God hath <hi>ſanctified</hi> let not man make <hi>common.</hi> It is againſt the natur of a thing ſegregated to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:121335:145"/>divine uſe, to be vulgarly mixt with our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane utenſils and touch and talkings; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is a contradiction in rearms; for if it be ſegregated from them, how is it mixed with them? if it be myſterious how can it be vulgar. And this is the judgment of the whole world, both preſent and paſt: Not onely maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans and pagans who evermore kept the book that ſpake forth the ſecrets of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſtill in that one language it was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in; but the Hebrewes too, as well as the Chriſtian Church: Nor was the bible, the law of Moſes, or the prophets, or hagiography ever put out of their hebrew into ſyriack, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Moſes time or after, either by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or any permiſſion of the high prieſts that followed. Nay it was ſo far from that, that it was not touched or looked upon by the people even in its own language, but kept privately in the ark or tabernacle, and brought forth at times to the prieſt who might upon the ſabboth day, which is our ſaturday, read ſom part of it to the people, and put them in mind of their laws religion and duty. Whereas the Chriſtian bible is in the hands of all who underſtand ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greek or latin. So great is the indulgence of the Catholick Church, and ſo good an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hath ſhe above all others of her children; though every one is not permitted to prattle and diſpute about it, as I think no wiſe man
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:121335:146"/>will think it fit they ſhould. And this retirednes of ſacred doctrin and rare approach unto the eye and ear with high reverence and ſolemnity, works in the minds of people a wonderful great awe and impreſſion of reſpect; whereas fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar uſage renders it contemptible. Indeed after that ſacred book becomes once to be ſlightly thrown about with ordinary touch and tongue, what doth it work but ſelf will and conceit, contentions, pride, ſchiſmes and wars? experience hath proved it: for every one hath a text both to defend himſelf and oppoſe his neighbour, whether it be in earneſt, or as it often happens in ſport and jeſt, whether wrong or rightly applied.</p>
                  <p>Nor can the Bible be well tranſlated; for the original carries oftentimes ſo great a lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and amplitude of ſenſes that it cannot be brought into a vulgar tongue without confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſignification, to the great alteration and perhaps ſubverſion of the holy penmans intention. Beſides, when men write or ſpeak with a ſpecial peculiarity of ſpirit, as all indeed do, but thoſe holy writers much more; this <hi>genius</hi> of theirs is ſo lapt up in their own words or ſounds, that by tranſmigration out of the coverture in which that Spirit was born and bred, as a ſnail in her ſhell, it doth in a manner quite expire and vaniſh. We find daily, that books tranſlated out of one tongue into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:121335:146"/>loſe much of their connatural grace and ſweetneſs, if not all the whole genuine power and life they carried in their own character. So tickliſh and volatile a thing is that hidden <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> couched in the rinde of mens words. Nor is a man better known by his face than writings; I mean, if he draw his diſcours and ſens out of his own bowels: for otherwiſe if he be only a book botcher or collectour out of other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, it will ſignifie little; which I take to be the reaſon why many ſpiritual books written in theſe times out of antient contemplatives, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the matter is the ſame and the language mended, yet be they in theſe penmen but dry unſavory ſtuff, which in the firſt authour was a fragrant raviſhing devotion; the good things therin contained have by their tranſmigration loſt their own ſpirit, and the latter authour, if ſo I may call him, had not another to give them anſwerable to their nature. By all this I would ſay thus much, that the Bible tranſlated out of its own ſacred phraſe into a prophane and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon one, loſes both its own property and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude of meaning, and is likewiſe deveſted of its peculiar majeſty, holines, and ſpirit: which is reaſon enough if there were no other, why it ſhould be kept inviolate in its own ſtile and ſpeech. Sacred doctrin like the perſons is not to paſs <hi>de domo in domum,</hi> but remain under that roof which firſt covered them. And as for
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:121335:147"/>peoples inſtructions, it is as I ſaid before to be made by the prieſts and paſtours of the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on whoſe lips the ſacred knowledg hangs and thence drops down upon the aſſembly, out of that book according to occaſion and times, as holy Church whole book that is ſhall judge it fit. We commit not to children the whole pot of <hi>honey,</hi> whereby they may ſurfeit and hurt themſelves, but give them only ſome few drops upon a ſtick of licoras ſo much as they can digeſt and make uſe of for their health.</p>
                  <p>And if the book wherin religious rites be grounded lawfully may, and in reaſon ought, and in practiſe ever hath been kept ſegregated in a language not common to vulgar ears; much more are the ſacred ſolemn rites themſelvs to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in a tongue that is ſegregated from common uſe, anſwerable to the Book according to which they be executed: which cuſtom as it renders that great <hi>Act</hi> more majeſtick and venerable, ſo doth it carry with it much of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience and no inconvenience at all. For thus the Church all over the world, as oppoſite to <hi>Babel,</hi> wherein were ſo many diviſions of tongues, ſhall as in heart and faith ſo alſo in lip and language be unanimous and linked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and the great work of Religion, wherein all Chriſtian people from one coaſt of heaven to another do unanimouſly conſpire, be ſo uniformly executed, that men may in all
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:121335:147"/>places of the world meet with their own Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church in one mode and faſhion both to acknowledg and joyn with it in their oriſons. Nor could otherwaies any one prieſt ſerve in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral countries, or adminiſter preſently in a place which himſelf or others with him had converted: for which caus men ſtudying to get that one language, which is ſtretched as large and wide as is the catholick Church throughout the world, have in all places one tongue, and that no hard one to convers withall; which did not the Church uſe it in her rites would in time be utterly neglected. The Hebrew Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immured in one Kingdom had not thoſe many reaſons which her younger ſiſter, whoſe territories are extended from Eaſt to Weſt hath, to keep her rites in a language differing from the vulgar; and yet ſhe did ſo.</p>
                  <p>Inconvenience in this practis there can be none aſſigned, but only this; that if the latin tongue be uſed at the altar, then cannot the vulgar people underſtand what is ſaid. But this is not of any moment. For firſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have all the whole ſcope and purpoſe and frame of ſacred liturgy ſet down in their own prayer-books, and if they will, in their hearts and mind; whereby they may if they pleas as equally conſpire and go along with the prieſt in their devotions, as if he ſpake in the mother tongue. Secondly catholick people come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:121335:148"/>not for other buſines at the Maſs, but only with fervour of devotion to adore Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified before them, and by the mediation of that ſacred blood to pour forth their ſupplications for themſelvs and others, which being don, and their good purpos of ſerving and pleaſing that holy Lord that ſhed his blood for us renewed, they depart in peace: This is the general pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos of the Maſs; ſo that eyes and hands to lift up, knees to bow, and hearts to melt, are there of more uſe, than ears. But thirdly there is no need at all for the people either to hear or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Prieſt when he ſpeaks and prayes and ſacrifices to God in their behalf: Sermons to the people muſt be made in the peoples lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; but prayers preſented to God for them if they be made in a language that God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands, it is enough.</p>
                  <p>This was well enough conceived by the whole congregation of Iſrael who commonly ſtood in vaſte multitudes without in a large outward court when the prieſt entered his <hi>ſanctum ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum,</hi> to offer and pray for them, who all the while were ſo far from hearing that they could not ſee him: this if any doubt, he may both diſcern it in the old law, and in our goſpel too; where <hi>Zacharias</hi> is ſaid to be praying at the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar when all the people ſtood without. Why then may not the younger ſiſter Church of
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:121335:148"/>Chriſtians likewiſe pleas and pacify her heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father with ſacred words and rites addreſſed unto him in the behalf of the people, although theſe do not underſtand, nay not ſo much as hear what is ſaid. And what matters it, if I pray for a friend whether he hear me or no, ſo that God unto whom I pray do hear and accept of my humble addreſſes. St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to Rome from Corinth moſt heartily in his letters requeſting their praiers; and he eſteemed it as good, as if he had himſelf been by and heard it; and yet the catholick altar is not ſo far from the people, as Corinth is from Rome. Wherefore in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> judgment one may pray for another not onely prieſt for the people, but people alſo for the prieſt, without being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, or ſo much as either heard or ſeen. Nor could St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his own reaſon ever deny the efficacy of thoſe praiers which be made by one for another in any whatever language, for it was all one to him what language the Romans ſpake; and if he did reflect upon it he could not be ignorant that they ſpake not the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Corinth when he wrote to them from thence, that they ſhould pray for him there at ſo great a diſtance.</p>
                  <p>But if any will yet be obſtinate and object unto me that S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf even in his epiſtle he wrote to Corinth from Epheſus, which was his firſt letter he ſent to that people, ſpeaks
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:121335:149"/>there about the end of the ſame letter very much againſt their praying and propheſying in an unknown tongue; he may know firſt, that even the tongue of the Romans whoſe prayers notwithſtanding S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted at Corinth was an unknwn tongue to thoſe that lived there, and yet that wiſe apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle would not we may think contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Secondly then, what was the matter? The buſines was this. There were in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches up and down many gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuities beſtowed upon Chriſtian people by that holy Spirit who would thereby exalt the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels glory, as extemporary propheſies, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of miracles, gift of tongues, and the like; and S. <hi>Paul</hi> hearing at Epheſus of ſome diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in Corinth upon that account, as thoſe kind of gifts are poſſible to be abuſed, he wrote to them about it, to let them know that the ſpirit of <hi>Jeſus</hi> for ſuch his voluntary donations unto men was indeed to be praiſed; but yet that Chriſtians ſhould not therefor place in thoſe things their utmoſt glory: and then to diminiſh further the huge eſteem they had there of gifts and tongues before all other, he lets them know that of all the other gifts, that in particular was liable to the greateſt inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, even far more than either wonder-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or prophecy. This is the apoſtles drift as any one may ſee that underſtands a grave and ſober
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:121335:149"/>letter. But what is all this to any ſervice of the Church.</p>
                  <p>But thirdly that I may make the thing yet a little plainer; the Latin in which the Catholick ſervice is kept is no unknown tongue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for that objection of no valiew againſt it. There is no tongue in the world can be ſaid ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely either a known tongue or unknown, but only with relation unto people; and ſo every language in the world is in reſpect of ſom people a known tongue and in reſpect of others an unknown. Engliſh is an unknown tongue to Vienna, but not to London; high Dutch is an unknown tongue to London, but not to Vienna: And therefor that we may conclude a tongue to be known or unknown, we muſt compare it to the family or people in reference to whom it is uſed, and no otherwiſe: and that family or people muſt be conſidered, not in any other reſpects if they have many, but only in relation to that particular rank or order which refers unto ſuch a language. An Engliſh merchant living in Anwerp hath two languages which himſelf and family ſpeaks, Engliſh and Dutch; and both of them in reference both to England and Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land jointly may be called both known tongues, and unknown: but in his buſines with the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, dutch is the unknown tongue, in his Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land affairs, engliſh. So the Pope as he is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and lord of the city of Rome ſpeaks
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:121335:150"/>Italian as all the other people there do, and it is the only known tongue in that degree and order; but as he is head of the whole Church ſpread over the earth, which is a myſtical body diſtinct from the body politick, and hath a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of its own quite differing from the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, that paſſes through Germany France and Spain, both Indies and the Iſlands, the north and ſouth world, whereſoever Chriſtians live, ſo he uſes and ſpeaks that general language which is latin: and in that ſens Italian is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue, and Latin only the known tongue of the Chriſtian world. So that in order to religion that one language that is ſpoken not in one corner, but runs quite through the hous, and is common to all as they be ranked in the ſeries of Chriſtianity, wherein they are trained up by the father of the family, and which in reference to religion he only ſpeaks himſelf, is the only known tongue in order to it and all other tongues unknown: And ſo not latin but engliſh, not latin but dutch, not latin but ſpaniſh is an unknown tongue to the Chriſtian world; for all theſe though they be the known languages of particular kingdoms which be but a corner of Chriſtianity, yet not they but latin is the known language of the whole Chriſtian body and family through the world. The hous of God is but one in it ſelf, although it be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſt over ſeveral nations, and the language fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:121335:150"/>for all the body muſt conſequently be but one, wherein all thoſe nations are united and linked together exteriourly, even as they be joined interiourly in faith, which in that one tongue is carried up and down and conſerved; and all other tongues, engliſh, french, ſpaniſh, be accidental to Chriſtians as they be Chriſtians, even as the times and places of their abode be, nor be they faſtned unto them by their Chriſtianity but by corporal birth and educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which be contingent and altogether acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental to religion. So then latin in reference to religion, which for reaſons above named muſt uſe one language, is ſo far from being an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue that it is the only one known language of the Chriſtian world, united to Chriſtian faith as the proper garment to a body, by whoſe faſhion it is diſcerned.</p>
                  <p>I know that a part of the Church uſeth greek in her Liturgy, and ſom few people Hebrew, as well as the generality does Latin. But I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only the latin tongue becaus my countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men take notice only of that. And all the three languages agree in this, that they are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated from vulgar uſe, conſecrated by the croſs of the Meffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, approved by the general paſtour, and equally liable to the preſent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, which is ſo trufatical that it caſts not the leaſt blemiſh upon popery for that cuſtom: and I hope all wife men will be of my mind.
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:121335:151"/>Our land me thinks ſhould thank the Pope for keeping his <hi>Maſs</hi> and <hi>Pſalter</hi> in ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue: For ſo our vulgar if they ſhould be curious to ſee it, yet can they neither be offended by what they hear, nor ſo much as diſcern that our own Engliſh communion-book is drawn out of the popiſh Breviary and Miſſal. To revile and hate a cuſtom whence we do our ſelves receiv ſo much benefit and no body and harm, is <hi>fals latin</hi> in morality.</p>

                  <p>EVen as to pleas the people and to draw and keep them from the catholick Church we threw the Bible amongſt them, telling them withall that as it is eaſie to underſtand, ſo is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man inabled to interpret it, although our Proteſtant Church does now too late repent it, and wiſh with all their hearts it had never been done: ſo likewiſe another plauſible advantage we took againſt the Pope and Church wherein thoſe people communicate commonly but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one kind, by giving all communicants a ſpoonful of wine together with their mouthful of bread: which ſtratagem has given as ample content as if people had been treated at my Lord Majors Feaſt. For who would not drink with their meat? and what reaſon can be given
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:121335:151"/>that they ſhould not? or that a feaſt with wine ſhould not <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> be better than with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
                  <p>But a little to abate our inſulting over a grave religious people, let me argue a little for them after my plain manner. Proteſtant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen you cannot but know, at leaſt you ought to know, that the catholick Church uſes the cup in communion as much as we in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land do, and in ſacrifice more; for ſo I diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh at this time that the ſacrifice is for the prieſt, communion for the people; more I ſay than we ever mean to do: for the deacon or miniſter at the altar after the prieſt had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the people with the hoaſt, carries the cup after him to all the ſaid communicants to drink: before which action of communion the Prieſt to prefigure Chriſts paſſion upon the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar and his blood effuſed had both conſecrated and conſummated both the kinds himſelf. Is not this enough to ſilence you? I ſhould think it were; ſince you are taken ſo clearly in a diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, at leaſt, that I may ſpeak no more, when you ſay that Catholicks have not the cup in communion, concealing what you ought to acknowledg both that the people have as much as ours, and that the prieſt conſecrates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummates both, which others do not. Oh but you will ſay, they give not the people the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated challice which is the very blood of
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:121335:152"/>Chriſt! very good, no more do Proteſtants; do we give the people any more then a cup of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wine? they do ſo too: if you anſwer, it is bleſt wine; know and remember, that when you ſpeak againſt the Prieſts conſecration, Oh then that bleſſing is nothing; but when you would argue againſt the communion in one kind, then you make ſomething of it: ſo likewiſe your own bleſſing of the cup when you talk againſt puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, o 'tis a great and venerable ſecret; but when you plead againſt Catholicks, then 'tis but an empty ceremony. Where ſhall any one hold ſuch ſlippery cells. But to omit theſe cavills. May not Anti-Romans be aſhamed to ſay that Catholicks uſe not the cup which they uſe as much as any, and to as much effect as we will allow it to be uſed, and yet more too? The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick people in communion (I muſt ſay it again that I may be underſtood) do drink of ſuch a cup as Proteſtants do affirm to be the only cup and no other; and over and above this communicate the very body of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer animated with his ſoul and ſacred blood, and hypoſtatically united to his deity, which thing Proteſtants neither do nor will allow it, although goſpel do both direct and command it. And yet we will be talking of I know not what defect of catholick communion, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring too, as we forget other things, that all the vertue of conſecration is attributed by
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:121335:152"/>Proteſtants only to our feeding upon Chriſt by faith; which no man can deny but that it may be totally done and compleated without touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either bread and drink: and therfore have they mightily laboured to make good, that when our Lord ſaith in St. John, <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed,</hi> that he ſpeaks not one word of ſacramental eating or drinking but only of feeding upon him ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the mouth of faith. May not Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks ſay the like to any text that ſhall be brought for the people communion of the challice? He is ſurely a mad man that ſo bela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours his adverſary in one argument, that by the ſame he knocks out his own brains in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. So then Proteſtants take from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple both the real body and blood of Chriſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and effuſed, and then exclaim againſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks for not uſing the effuſed ſpecies as well in communion as ſacrifice. We who hold nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as we ought, condemn them for withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one who hold both, and call that in them a ſacriledge with we our ſelves eſteem but a ceremony. The catholick Church feeds her people with real meat; we feed ours with ſigns and husks: Though others might upbraid the witholding of one kind, if it were ſo, yet ſurely we cannot ingenuouſly do it, who have taken away the reallity of both. Whatſoever Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants do truly hold and teach concerning this
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:121335:153"/>ſacrament, the ſame do catholicks from whom they had it, maintain too: and what more ought to be done, the Catholick Church does it and Proteſtants do it not. Muſt we feed upon Chriſt crucified by faith? Catholicks do it, and it is the very end of their religion. Muſt the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt be taken in remembrance of him, and commemoration of his death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They do it. Muſt both kinds be bleſt and taken? they do that too. Muſt the people drink wine out of a cup in communion, Catholik people do the like. On the other ſide, Catholicks do really partake of the animated and living body of their Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: this ought to be done to the end we may have life in us. And yet Proteſtants do it not. Catholicks have it continually ſacrificed before their eyes, and the very death and effuſion of their Lords blood prefigured and ſet forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them for faith to feed upon. This Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants have not, they do it not; and yet this ought to be done; for ſo our Lord command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when he ſaid to his apoſtles, <hi>hoc facite;</hi> this do ye which you have ſeen me to do, and in that manner you ſee me do it, exerciſing before your eyes my prieſtly function according to the order of <hi>Melchizedech,</hi> with which power I do alſo inveſt you, and appoint you to do the like even to the conſummation of the world in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of my death and paſſion, exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſhewing forth your Lords death till he
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:121335:153"/>com. This I ſay Proteſtants do not, and we are mad angry that the Papiſt does what his redeemer injoined him. Thus far <hi>ad hominem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conſecrated challice is not indeed ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily given by the prieſt to people in private communion. And it is neither expedient it ſhould be ſo, nor neceſſary to any effect of communion: nor yet is ther in goſpel any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for it. It is not neceſſary unto any effect either in the Proteſtants way which is fals, or in the Catholick way which is true. In the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants doctrin all the effect of communion is wholly attributed to the operation of faith, and Chriſts words ſay they are to be taken ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and not literally, for fleſh and bloud profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing: And therefore according to them one kind is enough, nay if we have neither kind there is no loſs but only of a ceremony, which may be ſupplied well enough at our ordinary tables. According to catholick doctrin whole Chriſt is really under either kind, and ſo it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in which kind we receiv. But it is not expedient ordinarily to communicate under the liquid ſpecies for danger of effuſion, as would ſomtimes happen in aſſemblies ſeverally diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And yet there may be reaſon by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the perſon to communicate rather in the liquid kind than the other, as when the communicant is young or ſick, and not able to take down the other: and therfore in antient
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:121335:154"/>times ſuch people were ordinarily communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the liquid ſpecies only, by the help of a <hi>ſpathula linguae,</hi> or little pipe made on purpos for that uſe: and for aught I know it may ſo be done ſtill upon the like occaſion. As for any precept of communicating under both kinds I never heard or read of any; none hath the great mother Church delivered either in her goſpel or out of it. For all the whole paſſage of the laſt ſupper whence Anticatholicks do principal ground their reaſonings, concerns on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſacrifice; how the apoſtles and their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours ſhould conſecrate and bleſs it; what they ſhould take to bleſs and conſecrate; and how they ſhould conſummate after conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And ther is not there any word or fact concerning the communicating of people; nor were ther in that time and place any lay peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at all to be communicated either man wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or childe, but they were all excluded: and if a man would draw negativ arguments as ſom do out of ſcripture, he might conclude out of that place that lay people are to receive in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind ſooner then in both. And although learned Saint <hi>Paul</hi> may inſinuate in his ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles that even the laiety did partake of Chriſts body, yet it may readily be anſwered in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants own grounds, if he did plainly ſay ſo, that he ſpake not of a corporall but ſpirituall communion.</p>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:121335:154"/>
                  <p>Indeed the whole manner of giving commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to the laiety is wholly left to tradition and to the judgment and diſpoſition of the Church; which appears more probable, for that the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church hath according to her own pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence unto ſome perſons in ſom times and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces uſed only the communion of the challice, to others only the ſacred bread, to others both; no man ever finding fault therewith or ſtartling at it as any new thing: and if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſcrupulouſnes of former ages we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think they would have riſen up and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt this, if it had been deemed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther new or ill; or if it had not been in the breaſts of all good Chriſtians preconceived and fully known, to be totally arbitrary and in the Churches power to communicate the laiety ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in both kinds or only one; and of the two in which ſhe pleaſed or thought moſt fitting for the condition of the communicant. This was certainly the opinion which Chriſtians ever had concerning communion. But as for conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſeems neceſſary to the integrity of the ſacrifice and the fruit thereof to the whole Church, and determined under a precept that it ſhould be made in both kinds: for ſo it was inſtituted to declare and ſet forth before our eyes the Paſſion of Chriſt and his blood effuſed; of which it could not be a compleat figure or repreſentation except both kinds were conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:121335:155"/>and ſo the effuſion expreſt. It was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite whole Chriſt crucified both <hi>quoad conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentiam</hi> and <hi>quoad ſignificationem;</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is not requiſite in communion where the thing contained is received and not the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification or mode expreſt.</p>
                  <p>This indifferent uſe of communion amongſt the antient Chriſtians in either kind, ſomtime one, ſomtime the other, ſomtimes both, is enough to verify that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> if it be taken, as it ought to be, in the literal ſenſe; <hi>We are all partakers of one bread and of one cup:</hi> For though either kind were lawful for any one, yet that any one kind was ſufficient, one may eaſily ſee was the opinion of that good apoſtle by what he ſpeaks in the foregoing comma; <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eat this bread or drink this cup of our Lord unworthily,</hi> &amp;c. and v. 24. and v. 25. repeating the inſtitution as our Lord delivered it, makes him after the conſecration of the bread ſay abſolutely, <hi>Do this in commemoration of me;</hi> but after the conſecration of the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice he ſpeaks with a limitation, <hi>Do this as oft as ye ſhall drink it in commemoration of me.</hi> So that the particle <hi>(And)</hi> in the other text, muſt needs be taken disjunctively, when he ſaith <hi>we are all partakers of one bread and of one cup;</hi> that is to ſay, all of us either partake of both, or each one at leaſt either of one or the other: which manner of ſpeech is very ordinary in all
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:121335:155"/>languages, <hi>Mulier eſt domus ſalus &amp; ruina,</hi> A woman, ſaith the proverb, is the ſafety and ruin of a hous; yet not conjunctively or both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but either the one or the other, according as ſhe is her ſelf either wiſe or fooliſh: and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more uſual in common ſpeech than to uſe this particle <hi>And</hi> disjunctively, when we ſpeak unto many at once, or of many: thus ten men riſing from a feaſt may ſay, we have fed heartily to day of fleſh fiſh and fowl; though one might haply eat only of one kind, another of another as it chanced, and yet not any one of all</p>
                  <p>If a man do ſeriouſly peruſe either the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, or Acts of the apoſtles wherein is delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the primitive religion of Chriſtians, he may eaſily gather that communion then was thought ſufficient under one kind, and that the ſpecies of <hi>Bread</hi> was moſt uſual to ſuch as were in health. For
<list>
                        <item>firſt, goſpel ſpeaks of as much ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of this one kind, as of both. <hi>This is a bread com down from heaven that if any eat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he dies not,</hi> Joh. 6.50. again, <hi>he that eats of this bread ſhall live for ever,</hi> v. 25. <hi>If any one eateh me the ſame ſhall live by me,</hi> v. 58. and he never there compares himſelf to wine as he does to bread, nor mentions the drinking as he does the eating of him. <hi>We are one bread and one body,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> all <hi>that do partake of one bread,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.13. And what is there more
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:121335:156"/>to be expected, but union with Chriſt and his myſtical body, immortality and life eternal with him, which all follow upon our worthy communicating of the ſacred bread.</item>
                        <item>Secondly, when our Lord brake bread with his diſciples in <hi>Emaus</hi> and ſo diſappeared, very great and antient divines do teach that he did before them the ſame ſacramental act he had himſelf inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and done aforetime before his apoſtles, and by that he was diſcerned: which interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is very probable, for there be ſet down the ſame words and geſtures, He <hi>took bread</hi> and <hi>bleſſed,</hi> and <hi>brake</hi> it and <hi>gave it</hi> to them, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.30. And if it were ſo, then it ſeems the cup was not thought neceſſary either by Chriſt himſelf or his diſciples; otherwiſe neither Chriſt would have done his work imperfectly and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed before he had given them the cup; nor would the diſciples have judged him by ſo doing to be their maſter, but ſom evil ſpirit or impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour, as who had kept the cup from them againſt their right: Nay by this example it ſeems that the very conſecration it ſelf may be diſpenced in caſe of neceſſity to be don only in one kind, though the complete ſacrifice and mode of ſignication would be unexpreſt.</item>
                        <item>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the firſt and ſecond chapters of the <hi>Acts of the apoſtles</hi> where mention is purpoſely made of the religious aſſemblies of the Chriſtians and their ſacred <hi>Synaxis,</hi> ther is much ſpeech there
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:121335:156"/>of their breaking of bread, but not any word of the uſe of a cup amongſt the people.</item>
                     </list>
And it is enough inſinuated as well directly in theſe forenamed places, that that was the religious work of the primitive Chriſtians, as it is indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly afterwards c. 20. One day of the <hi>ſabboth</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>when we came together to break bread.</hi> No mention being made any where in all that book of the challice at all. So that I muſt conclude, as I ſaid before; that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the challice is neither neceſſary to any effect of the ſacrament, nor expedient to be generally practiſed; nor is there in goſpel or ſacred writ any either precept or preſident for it. But the autority and practis of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church deſcended from the apoſtles is in this as in all other points the beſt and moſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable convincing argument, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> in another caſe kept for his beſt and laſt refuge, 1. Cor. 11. <hi>If any one</hi> ſaith he <hi>will be contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous we have no ſuch cuſtom nor the Church of God.</hi> And if there be no ſuch cuſtom in the Church of God, let not any of us be any further contentious.</p>

                  <p>I Do not remember that ever I took into my hands any catholick <hi>Breviary</hi> or <hi>Miſſal</hi> or
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:121335:157"/>other prayer book, but it had prefixed before it a calendar or catalogue of great <hi>ſaints</hi> amongſt them, apoſtles, martyrs, confeſſours, virgins, of whom the Catholicks keep a very reſpectful memory, as of the temples wherein God did once dwell and work wonders in the Church. And although this act and cuſtom of theirs be made by our voluntary interpretation a thing of much offence and ſcandal againſt them, yet looking upon it with an unprejudiced eye I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcern it to be any other than the civility of a due reſpect: For what ingenuous noble ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit would not do as much for the great heroes of his own family that have upheld and innobled the hous. And what ſayes Chriſt? would he not have it done ſo to his? ſurely if theſe things had not been don in his Church, but all memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of him and his blotted out, according to the fanſy of every reformer, we had had by this no more certainty of him than of <hi>Jove</hi> or <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury.</hi> But what ſayes he therefor? <hi>He that loves me ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him and make my manſion in him, &amp;c. he that leavs father or mother for my ſake ſhall ſit upon thrones, &amp;c. he that ſhall overcome and keep my words unto the end I will give him power over nations, as I have received from my father, and I will give unto him a morning ſtar, &amp;c.</hi> and the like promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of glory I ſtand not now to mention. And I ſhould think whom God and Chriſt ſo
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:121335:157"/>highly honours that we may honour them too, nay I beleev we ſhould; for a good ſervant ought to reſpect him his maiſter loves. And what are we afraid of? leaſt people by much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon ſuch eminent examples of vertue ſhould be moved therby to imitate them? what can it be els? If ſaints were propoſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed unto us, like <hi>Mars Jove</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> eminent both actours and patrons of vice, then we might juſtly blame it: But who can diſlike of an example of heroick vertue, though it were in a Romance. And all thoſe ſaints even from the firſt of <hi>January</hi> to the laſt of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> are ſo commended for their ſacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements, raviſhing contemplations of Gods love and the life to come, carnal mortifications and caſtigations of body, faſtings, abnegations of themſelves, exceſſive charity, daily renewed reſolutions againſt the world fleſh and devill, and valorous attempts for the love of Jeſus to juſtifie his truth and goſpel even to the effuſion of their bloods, that we read nothing els of them; all which is but what Chriſt and his apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles both by example and word either preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed or at leaſt counſelled both them and us to do. And who can make bitter gibeing inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives againſt them and their legends, but only he who is an enemy to the vertues there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended? What my ſelf and others in England have read and heard againſt Popiſh <hi>Saints</hi> it
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:121335:158"/>would be tedious to ſpeak; but I find it to be the ſpirit and genius of them that depart from the Popes religion: <hi>Luther</hi> the <hi>Hectour</hi> ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant was excellently dextrous at this feat of diſabling perſons of renown, and before him his grandſire <hi>Wicleph,</hi> who publickly affirmed that St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Bennet,</hi> St. <hi>Bernard</hi> and other ſuch like men were damned in hell for founding religious orders; yea and even <hi>John Calvin</hi> himſelf that holy faced man was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temtemperatly given to this theiomachy, that he opened his mouth not only againſt all ſaints and their memorials in the regiſter of the Church, but even the renowned perſons both of the old and new teſtament canonized in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly writ; <hi>Noah, Abraham, Rebecca, Jacob, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel, Job, Moyſes, Joſuah, David, Elias, Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias, Daniel;</hi> The B. Virgin <hi>Mary, S. Joſeph, S. Mary Magdalen, Martha,</hi> the <hi>haemorroiſs Woman</hi> who touched Chriſts garments, <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, S. Paul, S. Matthew, S. Luke, S. Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi> the husband of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>S. Denyſe Areopagite, &amp;c.</hi> and his own words againſt all theſe I could eaſily ſet down, but that I would not tire my reader nor foul my paper with his detracting unſeemly ſpeeches. But I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left to my own reaſon, ſhrewdly ſuſpect him to be an enemy to vertue, whom I find to calumniate and diſable all thoſe perſons who by authentick hiſtory are ſo much commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:121335:158"/>for it, and by the ſame propoſed unto us as an enſample of our lives. It is not only their due, but our benefit to keep the memory of ſaints before us.</p>
                  <p>Beſides that man cannot eaſily forget his own imortality after our deceas, who often rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates upon ſuch vertuous preſidents whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead he honours as yet living. Honourable mention of <hi>Saints</hi> deceaſed proves an immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the ſoul, and this immortality renders the ſaints even after their deceas ſtill more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſo that he that honors them muſt needs believ this, and he that truly beleevs this will be apt to honour them. <hi>I am God of Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, God is not the God of the dead but of the living;</hi> ſo argues and diſputes our Lord Chriſt, proving the ſouls immortality by the honourable mention of ſouls departed. And his argument is good and very ſubtile; for if God be the God even of ſouls departed, then ſouls departed are not nothing but ſom ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing; for God cannot be ſaid to be the God of that which is not. And theſe two ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, a beleef of our immortality, and a prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to imitate their good works ſo highly crowned, hath this memorial of ſaints wrought all over the catholick world, where ther is not a man but will urge himſelf ſomtime or other for the reſpect he bears to ſuch a glorious ſaint, who by ſhedding his blood or mortifying his
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:121335:159"/>body magnified God and his religion upon earth, to do ſomthing either of pennance or charity ſuperabundant, over and above what he ſhould have thought upon himſelf without that help in imitation of the good pattern of him, who being once a man compaſſed with the ſame infirmities that we now be, hath ſhewed us not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witſtanding both by his life and doctrin that ſuch good works are both feaſible by frail man, and very commendable too, and beneficial even to the reward of never ending glory. And to this end do Catholicks read their ſaints lives, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring each one to the degree of his devotion to rais up in himſelf the lively ſparkles of hope and faith and charity, by thoſe examples which he ſees not confined only to the one age of the apoſtles, but tranſlucent in all times and places by his continued goodnes to his Church whoſe mercy endureth for ever.</p>
                  <p>Nor are thoſe ſaints lives ſo prodigious and incredible as we in England take them to be, I ſpeak of ſolid authenticated legends. For I have my ſelf ſeen with mine own eyes and known hundreds of living men that have equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them in thoſe practiſes. And he that knows the vigorous nature and life of Goſpel, where it is really put to practiſe and not only verbally profeſt, will wonder at nothing. <hi>If ye ſay to this mountain, remove hence</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>to aright beleever all things are poſſible:</hi> and I am
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:121335:159"/>confident by what I have ſeen my ſelf, that ther be now, as bad a world as it is, an immens number of people among Catholicks as eminent in all perfections as ther have been in any age, and ſom of them equall too even to the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſaints of old whoſe legends we read. For thouſands of people do make it their very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, even as people here in London ſet up and profeſs a trade, to lead their lives exactly according to the tenour of goſpel, noting eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evening before they ſleep all the deviations even of their very thoughts, and making reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions in the morning for the renewed practis of all ſuch vertuous actions that may probably lye in their way; and in particular, ſuch a vertue to day, that to morrow, this in the third: and ſo they end their lives. All the Catholick world knows I do not lye. And all this is don not by any force of nature, but againſt it, by the meer power and vertue of their religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I have known many men to ſubdue corrupt nature even to amazement and miracle. And the various examples both of good people yet alive and of eminent ſaints departed, whoſe cells and veſtments, and beads, and books are yet reſerved amongſt them, incourage Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks unto this vertuous adventure; while not only by ſight of their lives who live amongſt them, and of the mortified figures of the holy perſons deceaſed, and bloody necks of their
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:121335:160"/>martirs, but alſo by ſermons and the continual rites of the Church prefiguring before them the converſation and paſſion both of Jeſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his many glorious followers who have imitated his ſteps, that none might think but that the ſame life might be led though not in the ſame degree, and the ſame valour be ſhown in undergoing both carnal caſtigations and death even by meer man, through the grace of him who ſtrengthens us to all things, they are made continually to remember and ſeriouſly lay to heart both what they are to do and whom to imitate; by which reflections they are more moved towards all the good works of piety, than without them ſuch a poor weak ſpirit as mans is, houſed in mouldring clay, could ever bee.</p>
                  <p>And that this hath been the practis of the Chriſtian Church in all times to ſet before the people the lively pourtraits of their holy and well deſerving foregoers, for their greater incitation unto ſemblable good works unto which their religion calls them, I could eaſily ſhow throughout all ages; but that I intend here to ſpeak no more than what may ſomwhat allay the preconceived prejudice we have taken up againſt the Popes religion, eſpecially in the few particulars I touch upon; of which I ſpeak no more than what I think may ſuffice to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beguile ſuch as liſt ſeriouſly to ruminate upon
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:121335:160"/>the truth. And if in theſe things which ſeem harder to us their caus be juſt, I ſhould think the leſſer prejudices ſhould fall away of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, and we at length love one another as we ought; for no man I think does willingly hate the innocent. Only two teſtimonies of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive reſpect unto ſaints and their images amongſt Chriſtians taken not out of the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the Church, but from her enemies, one from the Jew, the other from the Pagan, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently known in hiſtory, I cannot but here mention. The Jews in the firſt three ages of the Church even from the apoſtles to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the great, accuſed the Chriſtians not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in private but even before the Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and Senate, of three great violations of Moſes law; firſt that they <hi>broke the ſabboth</hi> and had turned it from the ſeventh day of the week unto the firſt, making that holiday which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ordained for work, and that a working day which <hi>Moſes</hi> made holy: ſecondly that they <hi>worſhipped images</hi> of <hi>their ſaints</hi> and kept them not only in their houſes but in their oratories and chappels: thirdly that they brought in a <hi>ſtrange God, Jeſus Chriſt</hi> they meant, which neither they nor their forefathers knew: all which ſeemed expreſly againſt the letter not only of the general law but of the two tables of the ten commandements. The pagan all over the empire laughed at the Chriſtians for three ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:121335:161"/>worſhips of theirs; namely of a <hi>brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den God,</hi> of the <hi>prieſts genitals,</hi> and of an <hi>aſſes head:</hi> the firſt whereof proves the primitive ſacrifice, of which I have already ſpoken; the ſecond their confeſſion; the third their uſe and reſpect they had of images: for the Jewes had defamed Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, whoſe head and half pourtraict Chriſtians uſed upon their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars even as they do at this day, amongſt other things of his great ſimplicity and ignorance.</p>
                  <p>Some will haply ſay, if this were all that is done to ſaints to keep the pictur and read the lives of ſuch renowned perſonages who conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated themſelvs to Gods glory and ſervice, for the incitement of our affections unto the like virtuous atchievements, I ſhould not much blame it: But papiſts over and above this do pray to <hi>ſaints</hi> too, and that is no wayes excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Give me leav to reply to this. That which you now ſay you cannot much blame, has been made ſo odious that never a Catholick in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land durſt for this hundred years ſo much as let a <hi>Crucifix</hi> hang in his chamber, leſt both he and it ſhould be torn aſunder by us. And what you judg in excuſable, their praying to ſaints which I have ſo often heard and read in our proteſtant Churches and books objected ſo eagerly and conſtantly againſt them, when I found it other-wayes than we in England conceiv it to be; I was glad both for their ſakes and ours too.</p>
                  <pb n="313" facs="tcp:121335:161"/>
                  <p>I did therfor curiouſly examin and turn over the whole Roman <hi>Breviary</hi> and <hi>Miſſal</hi> which is the devotion of the Catholick Church, and contains, almoſt a fourth part of it, a comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of ſeveral <hi>Saints,</hi> according to the daies of the year wherin they flitted hence into a better life. And I did not meet with ſo much as any one prayer addreſſed to any ſaint or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of heaven, no not upon thoſe dayes wherin commemoration of them is made; but direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all of them from the very firſt prayer to the laſt unto God the father by Jeſus Chriſt in the unity of the holy ghoſt either expreſt or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. And their practis herin is conform to antient tradition confirmed by their own law in a councel at <hi>Carthage</hi> under Pope <hi>Siricius</hi> an. 397. wherin it was declared and ordained that all publick prayers of the Church ſhould be made directly unto God the Father. And Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks even upon a ſaints day, making their prayer to God, beg only of him amongſt other their requeſts, that the good works of ſuch a ſaint in whom he glorified himſelf, may ſpeak better things for them than they can themſelvs deſerv. For example upon St. <hi>Bennets</hi> day, <hi>Interceſſio nos quaeſumus Domine Benedicti Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batis commendet, ut quod noſtris meritis non vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ejus patrocinio aſſequamur.</hi> Upon the feaſt of St. <hi>Francis, O God who by the merits of St. Francis doeſt inlarge thy Church with a new off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:121335:162"/>grant unto us by the imitation of him to deſpiſe earthly things and enjoy celeſtial.</hi> And ſo run all the other praiers of the Church wherin any invocation of ſaints is made, directed ever unto almighty God by his ſon Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And this is no more than what was ever don in the Hebrew Church both befor and after Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity was in the world, as the works of ancient Rabbies can witnes, and no leſs holy writ it ſelf, when it makes almighty God ſooner as it were condeſcending to the peoples petition by the mediation of the merits of glorious patriarchs whom he ſingularly favoured, and his wrath and diſpleaſur againſt the Jews then at a height when he refuſes to hear thoſe ſaints in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. <hi>If Moyſes and Samuel,</hi> ſaith the ſacred text Jer. 15. <hi>ſhould ſtand before me, yet is not my ſoul unto this people:</hi> that is to ſay, he would not in the behalf of ſuch deſperate wicked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, accept of the praiers even of thoſe ſaints that were moſt dear unto him: and this was ſpoken by the prophet long after <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> was dead. Long before this the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch <hi>Jacob</hi> does moſt plainly inſinuate this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of ſaints invocation as ordinary and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar among the Hebrews, when being to bleſs his two nephews <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> he ſpeaks thus. <hi>The angel who brought me out of all my evils bleſs theſe children, and upon them be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated my name and the name of my fathers,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:121335:162"/>Abraham and Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 48. And ther is a formal prayer to that purpoſe Exod. 32. which expreſſes as much invocation of ſaints as any, or all the praiers of the Chriſtian Church do ever uſe. <hi>Remember</hi> ſaith Moſes, <hi>remember O God, Abraham, Iſaac and Iſrael thy ſervants unto whom thou haſt ſworn by thy ſelf, ſaying I will multiply your ſeed as the ſtars of heaven:</hi> Which prayer was after imitated by <hi>Daniel</hi> c. 3. <hi>Withdraw not O Lord thy mercy from us for Abraham thy beloved, Iſaac thy ſervant, and Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael thy holy one.</hi> And if <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> praied to ſaints well may we do it: and if that of theirs was not a praying to ſaints, but only to almighty God by the concurrence of their merits, then is the Catholick Church to be not excuſed only, but commended; for ſhe does the like in thoſe prayers of hers ſhe makes any mention either of ſaint or angel and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                  <p>In their letanies indeed and ſhort ejaculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Catholicks ſeem to invocate ſaints direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when in one part of them they ſay: <hi>Holy Mary pray for us,</hi> St. <hi>Peter pray for us, &amp;c.</hi> But this though in words and ſound it ſeems direct, yet in ſenſe and purpoſe it is indirect; ſo that <hi>ſancta Maria ora pro nobis; omnes ſancti Dei intercedite pro nobis,</hi> is in ſenſe but this, <hi>Sancta Maria &amp; omnes ſancti intercedant pro nobis ad Dominum ut nos mereamur, &amp;c.</hi> And
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:121335:163"/>if we ponder it right, it muſt needs be ſo: for when I pray any one to pray for me, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the object and matter of my deſire which both of us muſt joyn in, I do not, properly ſpeaking, pray to him but by him; and only deſire in my good affection, that the prayers he makes for all may be available unto me. And this is the more apparent, becaus the letanies are directed unto God, beginning, continuing, and ending with him. <hi>Lord have mercy, Chriſt have mercy, Lord have mercy, Father of heaven God, Have mercy on us, O Son redeemer of the world God, Have mercy on us, &amp;c. Holy Mary pray for us, St. Michael pray for us, &amp;c. Be propitious, ſpare us O Lord. From all evil, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us O Lord, &amp;c. By the myſtery of thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, Deliver us O Lord. By thy nativity, Deliver us O Lord, &amp;c. We ſinners, Beſeech thee to hear us. That thou grant us peace, We beſeech thee to hear us, &amp;c. Lamb of God that takeſt away the ſins of the world, ſpare us O Lord, &amp;c. Lord have mercy, Chriſt have mercy, Lord have mercy. Our Father, &amp;c.</hi> Thus the letanies run and he that directs, continues and ends his leta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or praier to God, muſt needs pray to him, and objectively to none but him. So that the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of any interceſſour muſt needs be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct in ſenſe, however it be expreſt in words; and can ſignifie no more but this, that God would gratiouſly accept of the prayers they
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:121335:163"/>make, in our behalf. For that they do pray for their brethren and adoptives of the ſame bliſs both reaſon and holy writ ſufficently aſſure us.</p>
                  <p>Nor is this way of expreſſing our deſires un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual in holy Scripture. <hi>Bleſs ye our Lord all the works of our Lord, bleſs ye our Lord O angels of God. O ſun and moon, bleſs ye our Lord, O ſtars of heaven bleſs ye our Lord, praiſe ye and magnifie him for ever, &amp;c.</hi> Thus pray the three confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours in Daniel. And the whole 148. <hi>Pſalm</hi> runs in the ſame tenour. <hi>Prais our Lord all ye angels of his, prais him all his powers, prais ye him O ſun and moon, prais him all the ſtars of light, &amp;c.</hi> Here is an invocation direct in words not only of the ſaints and angels, but ſtars and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors, earth and ſeas, froſt and ſnow, heat and cold, light and darknes. And yet I am not bound who uſe that devotion to make it good that the ſun and moon, or other things there invocated hear me when I ſpeak to them in this manner: ſith I do but only expreſs my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and deſire that ſun and moon, heaven and earth, froſt and ſnow, heat and cold, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and hills be in their manner inſtrumentall to the almighties prais and honour, whether in words I ſpeak directly to the ſun and moon, as I do in that Pſalm, or expreſs my ſelf otherwiſe, ſaying; <hi>May the ſun, moon, heaven and earth concurre with me to the honour and prais of God
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:121335:164"/>mighty:</hi> the affection and meaning is ſtill the ſame. Nay the kings and princes of the earth whom in that ſame Pſalm I invocate to my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance do not more hear me when I ſay that Pſalm in my chamber, than do the mountains and hills. In like manner it is all one for me to ſay either thus: <hi>Let the prayers of the ſaints and angels of God aſſiſt my condition with the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty holy one;</hi> or thus, <hi>Pray for me O ſaints and angels of God to aſſiſt my poor condition with God almighty and holy.</hi> The devotion is as good this way as the other, and all one and the ſame thing. And the antient Chriſtians uſed indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently either the one way or the other, according as they deemed either this or that more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and pathetical to the exciting of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and obtaining their deſires with God. Nor did thoſe wiſe and devout people over enter into the curioſity; whether the ſpirits of another world did either ſee or hear or know what we ſpeak or think or do in this: much leſs did it ever enter into their <hi>creed</hi> that they do ſo. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a thouſand years aroſe our Schoolmen who amongſt other of their ſubtilities raiſed the difficulty, <hi>Whether Saints in another life hear and ſee all our motions in this:</hi> and generally they defended, and neatly declared both that they did it, and alſo how it might be done; namely by the mirrour of divine eſſence ſeen and enjoyed by the bleſſed. But this
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:121335:164"/>is a meer nice theological ſubtility and no buſines of faith at all, neither for the mode how it is done, nor yet for the doctrin that it is done. And if thoſe ſchoolmen thought this their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin neceſſary for any practis of ſaints-invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Church, they ſhowed themſelvs not ſo good rhetoricians as they were logicians. He that will defend pure naked faith is not bound to enter upon any ſuch diſpute with the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or go any further than his faith reaches; for ſo he does but intangle religion and expoſe it to needles doubts. But this is a great miſtake of many men otherwiſe of very great parts that they think what they have heard in the ſchools of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> or <hi>Scotus</hi> is all of it <hi>de fide;</hi> not conſidering that the ſchoolmen rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a thouſand queſtions and invented ſeveral declarations like ramparts about the <hi>cittadel of Faith</hi> to inable men to ſpeak againſt all oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeveral wayes; either in the way of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> or <hi>Scotus, Gandavenſis, Durandus, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reolus</hi> or other doctour, not to oblige them to defend thoſe waies as the <hi>cittadel</hi> it ſelf, when it ſhall com by any adverſary to be oppoſed. And although with ſom Antichriſtian great wits, as <hi>Plotin, Porphyrius, Julian</hi> ſuch ſubtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may be ſpoke of, yet ſtill with this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it muſt be done, that they firſt underſtand that Chriſtians are not bound when they defend the ſimplicity of their faith, to make good thoſe
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:121335:165"/>ſubtilities beſides it. But with a groſſer textual opponent as our Proteſtant is, ſuch curioſities are not at all to be touched. For he concludes preſently that invocation of ſaints is not to be uſed, if any one go about to tell him that they hear our prayers, and make it not ſink into his head how they can do it. And thus catholick faith is prejudiced for want of wiſe comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the defendant.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo another little defect in ſom late catholick writers, that in their controverſies with Proteſtants, wherein they hold that it is lawful to pray unto ſaints, they conſider not that they mean it one way and their adverſary another. This ſhould firſt have been cleared, before they had proceeded to perſwade what could never enter into our Proteſtant heads in the ſens they underſtood it. For properly and ſtrictly ſpeaking, to pray ſaints or by them is one thing, to pray to them is another: that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates the means, this the final end and object of our prayer; and the Catholick uſes it in the firſt ſens, the Proteſtant underſtands it in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as I know by my experience and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with them in all places. St. Paul in his epiſtle to the Romans as elſwhere very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently calls the Chriſtians <hi>Sanctos</hi> ſaints, and in the end of that epiſtle earneſtly importunes them to help him in their prayers for him unto God. And yet will Proteſtants never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:121335:165"/>for all that, that S. Paul prayed to ſaints: and indeed in their ſens he did not; but that he did pray to ſaints in the catholick ſens, that is prayed ſaints or prayed by ſaints no ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional man can deny. And ſuch and no other is the devotion of catholicks in this kind, ſave only that their practis is more plauſible than that of St. Paul now mentioned. If the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſuch as be <hi>in viâ</hi> and ſinners in ſom part of their converſation, though ſaints in profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, be ſo uſeful and may commendably be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; much more thoſe of conſummate ſaints <hi>in patriâ,</hi> abſolute friends of God and parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his glory: theſe the ſacred text aſſures us that they pray for their brethren, but men in this life although they be requeſted may neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to do it, their prayer is ſurely effectual one way or other to our good, when men of this life may obtain for us haply nothing at all. Nor is it of any purpos whether they hear us or no, ſith we do but pray them to do for us what we are aſſured they do for all; and ſo apply the benefit of their prayers to our ſelvs; or pray by them not to them, or to them in the catholick but not in the proteſtant ſens.</p>
                  <p>If any one like not this my way of explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this holy cuſtom of the Church, he may uſe what other he pleaſes. But this I do uſe as moſt facile and connatural to pious oratory, which eaſily diverts unbeleevers objections, and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:121335:166"/>beſt anſwers to the ſtate not only of Chriſtian ſaints but alſo thoſe of the old law, who could not ſee the neceſſities of men upon earth by any mirrour of divine eſſence which then they enjoyed not, and yet they were prayed unto then, as well as the Chriſtian Saints be now. And to me it ſeems irrational to defend an eaſy cuſtom of religion by a hard ſubtility of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, which clears not but renders that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and doubtful which was clear and utterly undoubted of before All Chriſtians ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved ſaints invocation to be lawful and pious, but it entered not into the <hi>Creed</hi> of any, that thoſe of another world either hear or ſee what we do in this: and this opinion brought to clear the other practis is harder to beleev than it, and no point of faith neither, although by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of Chriſtian Philoſophers it be rendered probable enough to ſuch as allowed of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian cuſtom aforehand.</p>
                  <p>This pious rite of ſaints-invocation common to the Hebrew and Chriſtian Church is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily juſtified upon the ſuppoſal of three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which all I think will grant.
<list>
                        <item>Firſt that Gods grace whereby men are made partakers of the divine nature is in a ſingular manner in ſome perſons more than others:</item>
                        <item>ſecondly that the ſouls of thoſe holy people and merits of their good works are immortal with God even after their death:</item>

And all proteſtant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, as <hi>Come unto me</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are but childiſh: for who does a man come unto or go unto but Chriſt and God alone, when he ſues to none but him for grace and mercy, whether he uſe or uſe not the helps of other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſour with himſelf to facilitate his requeſt. As innocent therefor is popery in this as in any other her religious practiſes, and we deſtitute of argument to carp at them for it. Let us therefore love and not hate, rather honour than diminiſh them without caus.</p>

                  <p>ALl over the catholick world prayers are conſtantly made for the dead both in publick and private: Inſomuch that one day in a week the altar is ſet apart for that purpos, and it is a rare thing when one half hour in every day is not ſpent there by ſome prieſt or other, together with the people for that end, nor is there a private perſon in the world that makes any oriſons apart, but will ſend forth ſom ſhort ejaculations for the <hi>requiem</hi> of ſouls departed before he give over. So that I may truly ſay, it
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:121335:167"/>is as ordinary for Catholicks to pray for the dead as for the living, and for one another as for themſelvs. And this cuſtom carries with it ſo great a ſhow of piety, that for my part I could never diſlike it; and I have heard but few diſcreet perſons ſpeak otherwiſe againſt it, than only as an ungrounded opinion. For of it ſelf what can it be but pureſt humanity to remember our friends when they are out of ſight; and to pray for them even after their deceas a moſt pious charitablenes. The queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, whether the doctrin be well grounded, or whether it may make for good accordingly to uſe it. If the deceaſed be utterly diſſolved, and ſoul and body equally extinguiſhed, then it is likely my praier cannot avail for any benefit; nor will it becom either my charity or diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to pray for them that are not: for God is not the God <hi>of the dead but of the living</hi> as our Lord ſpeaks; nor is he to be requeſted for bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits to any thing that is not exiſtent, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely incapable to receiv them. But if their ſouls be ſtill immortal with God, where or in what condition ſoever they be, it cannot hurt I ſhould think either me or them to wiſh them well: for whereſoever they are, if ſo be they are any thing, they are preſent to God, who fills all things, if not more yet aſſuredly as much as we that live this mortal life, and as they themſelvs were, when they lived amongſt
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:121335:167"/>us; and God whom we pray unto is equally preſent both to them and us, who aſſuredly hears and ſees and knows us both. And ſince the Almighty has ſet a limit to our knowledg, none to our, charity towards any man, no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be given why I may not wiſh well unto them all my life time even after their deceas, whom I might pray for while they lived, even by the command of him who bad me do well unto all, and have love which is ever accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with well wiſhes and praiers, even to my very enemies; never preſcribing me either li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of time or meaſure of charity. Thoſe I pray for after their deceas muſt needs be, if they be yet ſubſiſting, either in hell or heaven or ſom third place; I ſpeak vulgarly that I may be underſtood, not heeding at all whether a ſoul in <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> philoſophy may be ſaid in rigour to be in any place or no; in right reaſon whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is, muſt needs be ſomwhere, and that is all my meaning. If the ſoul I pray for ſhould chance even then to be in heaven; then my prayer for him is anſwerable to Gods will, and ſo not evil but good; whiles I beg reſt to him to whom God hath given it: for prayer though it often ſuppoſes, yet it doth not neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a want of the good thing prayed for in him I wiſh it unto; otherwayes I could not ſay as well and truly <hi>Our father who art in heaven: ſanctified be thy name, thy kingdom com, thy will
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:121335:168"/>be don:</hi> as I ſay afterwards, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread, &amp;c.</hi> In the former there is no want to be imagined; for they both are and ſhall be, whether I pray ſo or no; and I do but only ſhow my love and charity to God, in wiſhing him to be as he is, moſt holy powerful and juſt, and deſiring that to him which he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does nor ever can want, all ſanctity, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and glory: but in the other requeſts a want is preſuppoſed before the petition. If he ſhould be in hell, fith it is not Gods will I ſhould know ſo much, I can no more be interpreted to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay his pleaſur than when I prayed for the ſame perſon upon earth and wiſhed him what he ſhould never have: for even then alſo I knew no more of Gods disfavour towards him than now I do; and my good wiſhes in both places preſented ever under a tacite condition of Gods good pleaſur, may be equally acceptable in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to any effect either to him or my ſelf for my charity towards him, as they would have been whiles he lived; for I ſhall ſtill have the merit of my own charity in complying with Gods precept of an unlimited love towards all all men, and he may receiv too as much good by my praiers now he is com to ſuch an end, as when he was going to it: eſpecially if he were according to the doctrin of ſom Proteſtants ſo deſtined to ruin by Gods unreſiſtable will, and by the torrent of that unavoidable decree ſo ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:121335:168"/>hurried to damnation, that all things even the beſt and moſt ſacred means make only for his deſtruction. Indeed if any ones final ruin ſhould be revealed unto me as now is I think the condition of evil angels, then in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for any ſuch I ſhould formally reſiſt Gods will; and therefor I muſt not do it: but ſo long as it lies hid, let not me dive into his ſecrets but look unto my own duty, which ſhall never turn to my blame, tho it may hap not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with the beneplacite of his hidden purpos. And in both caſes, either of the final bliſs or ruin of him I pray for, ſuch kind of ſuffrages though they may prove not to be <hi>adjumenta mortuorum,</hi> yet are they ſtill <hi>conſolationes viv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But laſtly if he be in any third place in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of glory, then without controul I may wiſh him what he is ordered unto, and do any good thing I ſhall know by ſuch means as I know all other points and pactices of religion, may further his expiation. And ſuch an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion have all Catholicks or ancient Chriſtians ever had of their forefathers, who died in the boſom of the Church, that they were as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of prayers after their death as before it; and that heaven was not ſo eaſily attained even by good and holy profeſſours, without ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent expiation of their venial tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:121335:169"/>without which men do rarely depart out of the concretion of theſe earthly tabernacles inclining ſtill to ſenſual propenſions, let their ſouls endeavour never ſo much by the help of Gods grace and ſacraments to expiate and clear their thoughts, or to raiſe themſelves to the object of eternal purity, whiles they breathed here below. Thus the caſe ſtands concerning this point.</p>
                  <p>And that every ſoul that paſſes out of the concretion of a mortal body with any ſenſuall contagion, after mortal ſins remitted, paſſes through ſome expiatory pains, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Purgatory, declared by the antients ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the notion of darknes, ſomtimes of ſcorching fires, before he can enter the place of glory where no inquinated thing can come, as it is an opinion can never be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivly either proved or diſproved, no more than other contingencies of Gods will, ſo becaus it is a thing as conſtantly beleeved in all ages of Chriſtianity, and as unanimouſly practiſed as any one thing I know, I do not ſee any reaſon it ſhould be ſo ſlightly thought of, or ſeverely condemned as I ſee it is by ſom, as an unground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed popiſh ſuperſtition. For it is not only the opinion of all orthodox Chriſtians, but of all people in the world, excepting only the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Luther who jeer at all things, that ther be other places where ſouls departing this life
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:121335:169"/>may have their reſort beſides hell and heaven; as if it were derived even with the ſouls immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality from the firſt inhabitants of the earth unto all their poſterity. The Pagans beleeved it, as appears by <hi>Virgil, Cicero, Lucretius,</hi> and the few remnants of their religion both under the Roman empire and elſewhere. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans that roſe a thouſand years ago, and took to a miſcellan religion made out of Pagan Jew and Chriſtian beleef, hold it to this day; and the Hebrews taught and profeſt it as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the antient Rabbies: as if this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a third place had come down even from Adam to all his whole progeny; firſt to Cain and Seth, by Cain to Enoch and his line; by Seth to Enos, and ſo down to Noah; from him to Sem Ham and Japhet; by Sem to the Aſſiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Aramites, Perſians; by Ham to the Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opians, Egiptians, Paleſtines, Cananites, Sido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Jebuſites, &amp;c. by Japhet to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, Medes, Bactrians, Indians, Babylonians, and iſles of the Gentiles; although it be ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally mixed and modified according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the various religions that profeſs it.</p>
                  <p>This opinion then of the ſouls immortality and its detention after death in ſom place <hi>citra coelum</hi> is not any new thing freſhly taught ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by our bleſſed Saviour or his Apoſtles, as any peculiar doctrin of his own, but taken up as granted by tradition of the Church of the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:121335:170"/>Hebrews, and ſuppoſed and admitted by all ſides for true, upon which our Lord built much of his own inſtructions. And that may be the reaſon that in his parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> which he recounted under the figur of a ſtory then paſt, he ſaies expreſly that <hi>Dives</hi> was in hell torments, but he does not likewiſe ſay of <hi>Lazarus</hi> that he was in heaven, but in the boſom of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Luc. 16. For heaven gates as they were indeed not opened unto any until the paſſion of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who firſt entred there as <hi>primogenitus ex mortuis;</hi> ſo neither did the Jews beleev that any ſhould have acceſs thither before his coming, as I think it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, to omit other places, in the Acts of the Apoſtles. For ther St. <hi>Peter</hi> preaching and proving before the Jews that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was riſen and aſcended into heaven, and was conſequently the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> he takes his argument to prove it out of a pſalm of <hi>David</hi> which ſpeaks thus, <hi>I foreſaw the Lord alwaies before my face, &amp;c. therefore did my heart rejoyce, &amp;c. becaus thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell, &amp;c. thou haſt made known to me the waies of life, &amp;c.</hi> This is his firſt ſubſumption. Then he goes on in his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. David was <hi>a Prophet,</hi> and <hi>foreſeeing</hi> the <hi>reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt he ſpake thoſe things <hi>of him;</hi> therfor Chriſt is riſen and our <hi>Jeſus</hi> is the Chriſt. This is St. <hi>Peters</hi> argument. Then he anticipates an objection: for ſome might ſay,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:121335:170"/>David ſpake not thoſe words of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> but of himſelf: unto this St. <hi>Peter</hi> replies with three reaſons; firſt <hi>David was a Prophet,</hi> and therfore he ſpake them not of himſelf, but of another whoſe reſurrection he foreſaw; ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he ſaith, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord ſit thou on my right hand, &amp;c.</hi> it was then the reſurrection and aſcenſion of one that was Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids Lord, therfore not of himſelf; again it could not be meant of David, <hi>for David aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not into heaven,</hi> which is an argument <hi>ad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem, ex conceſſis:</hi> as if he had ſaid, you all know and beleev that neither <hi>David</hi> nor any of the Patriarks aſcended after their death to their finall reſt, but ſtaid in ſome interjacent repoſe till the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould com and lead <hi>captivity captive;</hi> that is to ſay, take along with him in his train and ſervice all thoſe holy prophets and patriarks of the old law, who had in their place of detention waited for the conſolation of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. I ſay St. <hi>Peter</hi> muſt ſuppoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition on which the firmitude of his whole diſcours was chiefly grounded to be admitted by the Jews for true, otherwiſe his argument had been inefficacious, and had neither proved Chriſts aſcenſion nor yet Jeſus to be Chriſt: and if the Jews had beleeved Davids ſoul to be in heaven though not his body, yet ſtill the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in my judgment had fallen ſhort. All this infers that the Hebrew Church did beleev a
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:121335:171"/>detention of ſpirits <hi>citra coelum,</hi> and that the <hi>Rich</hi> man might go to hell before Chriſt, but <hi>Lazarus</hi> the happy went but into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſom, that is to ſay, unto that repoſe where <hi>Abraham David</hi> and all the antient patriarks ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the light and redemption of Iſrael, and not into heaven it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And they might very well ſo beleev, for how can any one hope for that upon anothers gift which he never promiſed, when he promiſed all other things but it; heavenly bliſs amongſt all the fair promiſes made in the law of Moſes was never ſo much as mentioned, nor thoſe people ever put in hope of it for any good work they ſhould do. But in the new teſtament of our Meſſias heaven which himſelf ſhould open to his faithful, is frequently promiſed as an immens motive and incitement to good words, they ſhould for his love by the aſſiſtance of his grace act and perſever in unto the end. Yet ſo too, as that in the execution of this promis it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently inſinuated, that if any ſpirit iſſue out of his body not abſolutely purified, himſelf may indeed by the uſe of ſuch means of grace as our Lord inſtituted, be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire, 1 Cor. 3. And therfore our bleſſed Saviour ſpeaking of the ſeverall treſpaſſes we make in this life gives us this counſel, to ſet all right and ſtraight as far as we can, while we are here <hi>in via,</hi> in the way of this life; for if once by
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:121335:171"/>death we be delivered up to the place of hold, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, or priſon, ther will be no getting forth thence till the utmoſt farthing be paid. Math 5. that is, as holy fathers do jointly interpret the place, till abſolute ſatisfaction be made either by ſufferance or ſuffrages. And that redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or remiſſion of ſome ſins may be had after this life is enough inſinuated unto us by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf when he tells us, that there be ſome ſins that ſhall never be forgiven neither in this world nor in the world to come: For if any ſhould tell me here in England that ſom criminall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences will neither be pardoned at the <hi>Seſſions,</hi> nor at the <hi>Kings bench</hi> at Weſtminſter, he ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently inſinuates, if he ſpeak properly, that releas may be had for ſom other offences in both the places.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his epiſtles, although he do ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times indirectly hint at this doctrin of expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after this life; yet does he not directly make uſe of it as a topick place, either in his exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to vertue or diſſwaſion from vice. But the reaſon is manifeſt, for being a thing mixt of good and ill, it could ſerv ſufficiently to neither purpos; and heaven being now lately promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to all thoſe that walk piouſly in Chriſt Jeſus was a more full and ſtronger motive of perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as alſo was hell a greater argument of affrightment, then the interjacent place of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation however penall could be, which by
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:121335:172"/>reaſon of the temporality of the ſufferance and hopes of approaching glory admits ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to mitigate the terrour; and again by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the penalty of that condition and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of expectation, carries enough of terrour to allay to comfort of the place. And yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally and without deſign ther is there to be found as much of purgatory as of the litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, the trinity, primitive abſolution, and other myſteries of faith. In a word, the thought of heaven ſerved well both to incourage people to the utmoſt perfection of charity and good works, and to comfort them alſo in tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which the memory of their expiation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could not do. And on the other ſide if any were wicked, for ſuch a one purgatory would neither be a ſeaſonable nor ſufficient me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace. Yet both all their life time and eſpecially when they came to dye, all records of primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times will tell us how careful the antient Chriſtians were to provide for their ſouls aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance after death. And accordingly S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> commends the piety of his mother <hi>Monica,</hi> in that ſhe begged ſo earneſtly of him her ſon to be mindful of her ſoul when he ſtood at the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, to pray heartily for her after her deceas: and he ſets down at large in the ninth book of his <hi>Confeſſions</hi> c. 12. and 13. the dirge and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and prayers he made both for her and her husband <hi>Patricius.</hi> And the doctrin of expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:121335:172"/>puniſhments after this life he teaches in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places of his many learned volumes: In his 20 book de <hi>civitate dei</hi> c. 9.13.16. and 24. In his <hi>comment</hi> upon the 37 <hi>pſalm:</hi> In his book of <hi>fifty homilies</hi> hom. 16. In his 41 ſermon <hi>de ſanctis.</hi> In the 110 chapter of his <hi>Enchiridion;</hi> In his book <hi>de cura pro mortuis</hi> c. 2. and 4. By which and other places we may ſee, that S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> was not only of this catholick opinion, but he was alſo a prieſt himſelf, who both taught and practiſed it, ſacrificing at the altar for ſouls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. And ſo was S. S. <hi>Bede, German Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinopolitanus, Jo. Damaſcen</hi> and <hi>Alcuin</hi> in the eight age of the Church, not to mention later times: S.

S. <hi>Ireneus, Hermes,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the ſecond; who were all of them prieſts, catholick Roman prieſts, and publickly taught, as I am able to
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:121335:173"/>make it apparent out of their works, this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable religious doctrin of the ſouls expiation after death, before it arrive to heavenly bliſs, by the prayers and pennances and alms deeds of the faithful left behind them in this world; and did it, and practiſed it themſelvs in their houſes, altars and oratories: according as they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it from the firſt age, which they found in an univerſal beleef and practis of the ſame truth; as even yet appears by the antient litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies and teſtimonies of S. <hi>Matthews;</hi> S. <hi>Mark,</hi> S. <hi>James</hi> the elder and the younger, S. <hi>Clement</hi> and S. <hi>Denyſe</hi> the Areopagite? Thus <hi>Popery</hi> did in old times and ſo it doth ſtill.

                  <p>THe catholicks, as I perceived by their books and practiſes, do all the world over pray for their <hi>Pape</hi> and paſtour with a moſt tender affection; which I eſteemed a piece of moſt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil piety practiſed in all ages for the comfort and good of him they look upon as ſupreme head and governour of their religion under God upon earth. We may perceiv in the epiſtles of
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:121335:173"/>good St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that to pray for one another was a thing very familiar to the primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; but when S. <hi>Peter</hi> their prince and head fell into danger, the whole Church then united their ſupplications in his behalf, as one in whoſe welfar they were univerſally and in a more peculiar manner all of them concerned: <hi>Peter was kept in priſon,</hi> ſaith the ſacred text in the Acts, <hi>and prayer was made without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the Church unto God for him.</hi> I doubt not but that they praied likewiſe for other apoſtles too, that God would keep and bring them out of danger; but the writer of that Story gives us no notice of any univerſal praier made for any one, but only <hi>Him</hi> the head and prince of all the whole congregation, therby to intimate the ſingular reſpect and love they did univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bear him.</p>
                  <p>But we in England do not more ordinarily call <hi>a Spade a Spade,</hi> than we do traduce, defame, execrate the Pope, and proclaim him, whom alſo we do not know, leud, wicked, ſenſual, proud, ſeducer, ſerpent, Antichriſt, and I know not what; and that not only in our ordinary ſociety but in books and ſermons; not only ſom of us but all hate him; not in England only but all proteſtant places; not now only but in all times ſince Proteſtancy began: and our very children by that time they com to be eight or nine year old are by our example and imitation
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:121335:174"/>inabled to ſay after us like parrets, <hi>Pope is a rogue, pope is a rogue.</hi> This behaviour of ours if it be not impious, yet no man I ſhould think will after ſerious conſideration deny it to be unmannerly. And what kind of ſpirit muſt this be, that delights ſo much in defamations and curſes! Surely the ſpirit of God is a meek civil and quiet ſpirit. Either the <hi>Pope</hi> is good, or evil; if he be good, why do we hate him? if bad, why do we not pray for him, as goſpel teaches us to do even for our enemies and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but ſtill defame and curs him to make him wors. I know much good he has don our land, even ſo much good as the Chriſtianity we had from him hath ever wrought amongſt us; but never any evil, no not in the leaſt kind. Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters above all others ſtand exceſſively ingaged to him even for the very bread they eat; for the formality of their clothes and caſſocks they wear; for the pulpits they preach in; for the pariſhes and tithes they liv upon; for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities they were brought up in; for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees they have taken there, and the canon of their ordination; for the catholick learned books they ſtudy; and the very goſpel they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do or ſeem to preach: all which were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from the Pope. And as for others of the laety; if the Churches they meet in once a week, and the hopes they have of a life to com; if the good wholſom laws of the land, if corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations

And yet we are ſo far from thinking of any of theſe things which might civiliſe us towards him, that tranſported, we cannot our ſelves tell how, with animoſity and paſſion, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh endleſly not only againſt <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but even againſt the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf, who as he never hurt us, ſo likewiſe doth he even to this day wiſh us all both temporal and ſpiritual good.</p>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:121335:175"/>
                  <p>And I ſhould think we might hereupon take occaſion to admire at the Popes great civility and temperance not again to be paralel'd in the world, who though he hath ſeen ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred virulent books writ againſt him, and heard more words; yet hath he never been known to let fall the leaſt word of paſſion againſt any, nor move any engine for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge: And thus much ſeveral of our countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have experienced of late years in Rome, where railing at the Pope even under his noſe, as a wicked proud Antichriſt, they received be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called before him no other check but this: <hi>My friends be peaceable while you are in my ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, leaſt the people ſhould fall upon you and hurt you; when you are out of my territories ſay of me what you pleaſe.</hi> I have ſeldom known any noble perſon, but if his honour were tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, eſpecially if falſly, undeſervedly, and by an inferiour perſon, and frequently, and in a high degree, but he would move more or leſs to a juſt reveng of his right. Only the <hi>Pape</hi> goes quietly on in his cours as the full moon in the firmament, which heeds not at all the barkings of ſo many curres that vainly open their mouths againſt her. But in the interim can there be any thing more unſeemly than a young Miniſter in a pulpit here in England, vapouring and talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before a congregation, that come thither to hear Gods word, againſt a gentleman, a
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:121335:175"/>grave venerable perſon, a byſhop, a Prince, who alſo living a thouſand miles off hears not a word he ſaies, and if he did would heed it as little. We read a ſtory, in the book of <hi>Kings,</hi> of a company of boies that mockt at <hi>Eliſeus</hi> a grave and venerable perſon, as he was going up to <hi>Bethel,</hi> crying; <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p baldpate, up baldpate;</hi> and the very bears iſſuing ſodainly out of the woods tore them in ſunder. May not we juſtly fear ſom ſuch like event for the like if not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter crime of ours ſhall fall upon us, who do not only call that venerable perſon and his prieſts <hi>Baldpate,</hi> but Antichriſt, frog, caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, ſerpent, &amp;c. Beſides the abſence of the perſon we calumniate, flout and expoſe to deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is a circumſtance that does not a little ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate the fact, and renders it no leſs fooliſh and irrational than 'tis unjuſt and rude. It is a wonder that our Proteſtant byſhops ſhould countenance theſe diſorders. A wiſe woman will not hear her child call her neighbor <hi>Whore,</hi> without the application of a juſt rebuke, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſuch like impudence being countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, may imbolden him at laſt to call <hi>Her</hi> ſo too. Indeed the judgment is already com home to our doors; for now our byſhops of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land are as contumeliouſly treated in the pulpits by their own miniſters, as the byſhop of Rome was by their connivance and applaus abuſed aforetime in the ſame place by the ſelf-ſame
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:121335:176"/>perſons. Nor have ther been any in this land more furiouſly bent theſe laſt twenty years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our good <hi>King,</hi> than they who to flatter our former princes moſt paſſionately reviled the <hi>Pope;</hi> and the ſeed of thoſe men who in the dayes of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, Queen <hi>Eliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> plotted ſo vehemently againſt the Catholick Church and nobility even to their utter diſgrace and ruin, under a pretens of eſtabliſhing our State, were now the onely great fighting ſticklers againſt our State and Monarchy. I give only this note by the way, to reach all men to do to another as they would others do to them, and no othewaies: for God is juſt and puniſhes all iniquity of men, (often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with thoſe very rods and ſcorpions, which themſelves uſed before to plague their innocent neghbours) who when they knew the juſtice of God, yet would they not underſtand that they which do ſuch things are worthy of death; and not only they who do them, but they alſo who conſent and yield compliance to the doers.</p>
                  <p>But that I may a little lay open to my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen the unreaſonablenes of our proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in hating and reviling a Perſon, whom Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks on the contrary do ſo much eſteem and love; to what I have already ſaid let thus much be added: That the <hi>Pope</hi> is one, whoſe whole life and ſtudy is to defend innocence, promote
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:121335:176"/>concord, and maintain unity of Faith in the world: nor is ther any man but he alone that looks to the general ſafety of all Chriſtianity; and in all times like a faithful paſtour he hath ſo don it, as if it were not ſo much his office to do it as his nature. And this we might eaſily ſee if we would look over antient ſtories, and not ſuffer our ſelves to be miſled by the reports of thoſe who think themſelves undon if he that would curb their extravagancies ſhould com to be thought of according to his true deſerts. I might make it good in many particulars: but I will content my ſelf onely to run over briefly the eighteen general councels that have been in ſeveral ages in the Chriſtian world, and their reſults and motives; wherby men may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to think that the <hi>Pope</hi> is ſo far from what we in England are made to conceiv of him, that he is the only man that hath fought in all times for the unity of faith, for concord and the good of all Chriſtendom; when other byſhops and believers under him began many of them to revolt and diſturb our welfar. Nor had we had any thing left us at this day either of truth or unity, humanly ſpeaking, had not he been ſet over us and watched to make and keep us happy even againſt ſom of our wills.</p>

                  <p n="13">13. Pape <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth found a great deal of trouble in the world, and to heal the malady he called a general ſynod at <hi>Lions</hi> an. 1245 which was the thirteenth oecumenical councel againſt the cruelties of emperour <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> who filled Chriſtendom with wars and bloodſhed, whence aroſe the faction of the <hi>Gwelfs</hi> and <hi>Gibellines,</hi> againſt the tirrany of the ſaracens the perfidiouſnes of the greeks who plotted at Conſtantinople the deſtruction of all the Latines, and againſt the irruption of the Tartarians who ruined Poland and Hungary.</p>

A little afterwards, when now <hi>Michael Paleologus</hi> had got the empire of greece by the expulſion of <hi>Baldwin,</hi> and the greeks began to fall back to ſom of their former errours, denying the Holy Ghoſts proceſſion, ſacrifice in unleavened bread, and ſome faſts: ſo that much combuſtion happened upon this occaſion in the oriental Church, Pape <hi>Gregory</hi> the tenth called the fourteenth councel at Lions an. 1274 for the healing theſe diſorders, recovery of the holy land, and union of the Greeks.</p>

Pape <hi>Clement</hi> the fift called a councel at <hi>Vienna</hi> to rectify both, as alſo for recovery of the holy land and reformation of diſcipline then much decayed in the Church.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. But ſtill there was much diviſion in the oriental part of the Church among the greeks, who denied many of them the proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt from the ſecond perſon of the Trinity, the felicity of the bleſſed, and purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in the Churches antient ſens, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of the Roman See, which although they held in the primitive times for many ages toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet they ſank into that dangerous errour by degrees; for after that they had got an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> abſolute and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, they motioned in councels kept in thoſe times for the moſt part in the oriental parts, firſt that the byſhop of that Sea for the honour of the empire might be made a Patriarch, then afterwards that he might have place before other antient patriarchs who had the right of precedency before him, and then at laſt they would have him independent as the emperour himſelf was in temporals: thus by degrees running themſelvs into ſchiſms. To prevent theſe errours and factions Pape <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> the fourth called the ſixteenth general
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:121335:180"/>councel at <hi>Florence</hi> an. 1439 where by means of <hi>Joſephus</hi> patriarch of Conſtantinople and other grave grecian prelates there aſſembled, the union betwixt the greeks and latins was made up.</p>

                  <p n="18">18.

                  </p>
                  <p>There have been in the Church beſides theſe greater councels ſix hundred other national, provincial, dioceſan ſynods, over and above thoſe which S. <hi>Peter</hi> kept with the apoſtles in
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:121335:180"/>Jeruſalem; which being called together upon ſeveral occurrencies were all licenſed guided and directed by the <hi>Papes</hi> of thoſe times, who kept continual correſpondence with the prelates while they ſate in councel: and if any ſynod ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oppoſed him or ſwarved from his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it was looked upon by the reſt of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as reprobate on that account.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould be too tedious, if I ſhould declare the indefatigable induſtry, high wiſdom and piety of Popes, in ſteering the Ship of the Church both in the calms of peace that ſhe might not then lye hulling and idle, but make good progreſs towards bliſs; and alſo in the ſtrang ſtorms and tempeſts that the malignity of this world hath raiſed againſt her, which have been ſo great and various, that one would have thought by the many leaks that ſprang in her at times, the exceſſive beatings of decuman bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows upon her ſides, the dangerous hidden rocks on which ſhe has daſht unawares, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er apparent ones ſhe has been carried upon by the violence of wind and weather not humanly to be avoided, that ſhe could never have laſted to this day. But thanks be to <hi>Him</hi> that provided a wiſe and vigilant Pilot, with whom he ſits himſelf inviſibly at the ſtern to guide him and ſuch as voiage in the ſame ſhip with him unto all truth even to the conſummation of the world.</p>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:121335:181"/>
                  <p>Hiſtories will tell us how careful and more then humanly happy <hi>Popes</hi> have been in all ages, in reconciling Chriſtian princes, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving difficulties between them, in examining of doctrines, in counſelling and perſwading high ſpirited children ready to fly out into he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies to humility and reſignation, in governing ſo many bodies of Religious which be all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected under him as other parts of the Church be, and are ſo numerous that one would hardly beleev ther ſhould be ſo many religious houſes in the Chriſtian world, all ſerving God night and day with that ſilence order and cleanlines every one in his way and inſtitute, that it is the goodlieſt thing in the world to behold. St. <hi>Bennet</hi> roſe in the ſixth age of the Church about the year 529. and yet about the year 1480. it is written that ther were then of his order fifteen thouſand monaſteries in the world: and the other families of <hi>S. Francis, S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, S. Dominick,</hi> the <hi>Society</hi> and others, are none of them much leſs numerous: and all theſe families have ſtill recours to the Pope both for their rule and ſtatutes, and for all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that may occurre in their ſpiritual govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And who can be ſufficient for all theſe things? None ſurely, but he that is ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly aſſiſted from heaven: and Chriſt our Lord in my judgment hath no leſs ſhown his divinity and power in the Pope, than in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:121335:181"/>as much in his ſpirituall and myſtick as he did in his natural body: and the life indeed which by his Spirit he livs in his Church is in a manner the very ſame with his naturall one: now praying, now diſputing amongſt the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, now faſting, then watching, then heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſick, and working miracles; then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, maligned, envied; ſomtimes at a feaſt, ſomtimes hungrying, ſomtimes making merry with a loaf of bread and few fiſhes, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples now defending their maiſter, now the maiſter defending his diſciples &amp;c. for ſo the Pope protects innocent beleevers, and theſe again defend him. But of all thoſe glorious things our Lord did in his life time, converſion of people, confutation of phariſaical oppoſers, releeving of poor, healing of diſeaſes and the like, he hath ſhown greater abundance in his Church than in himſelf, according as himſelf promiſed; <hi>Ye ſhall do greater things than theſe.</hi> Which confutes the antient calumny of our old adverſary the Jew, who aſcribed all our Lords miraculous operations either to ſom gipſie tricks he learnt when he was in Egypt, or to ſom evill ſpirit he had got to attend his perſon: either of which had it been true had failed with his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and his power had not extended to his Church. And all things conſidered I think I may truly ſay that Chriſt in the Pope and Church is more miraculous than he was in his
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:121335:182"/>own perſon: and I doubt not but the nativity of his Church, and miraculous converſation, paſſion, reſurrection and aſcenſion ſhall be the ſame with his. So that he who contemns the Pope contemns Chriſt who preſides in him, and he that contemns the Church villifies his ſpirit which lives and movs and animates that body.</p>
                  <p>I could be very copious in this ſubject; but I muſt not be prolix in any thing. I only deſire my reader to conſider this one thing, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſerious thought he will find to be true, that if there had not been Popes in all ages both to conſerv and propagate faith, we had either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard any news of Chriſtianity here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, or not kept it undiſturbedly ſo long. All the whole goſpel and body of Chriſtianity is his, purely his, and from him we received it. Nay the firſt great fundamental of Chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is the Truth and divinity of Chriſt, had it not been for him, had failed long ago in the world: and what then had becom of all the reſt? For after Pope <hi>Sylveſter</hi> according to the faith of his anceſtors had by means of his three Legates great <hi>Oſius</hi> biſhop of Corduba, <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Vincent</hi> two prieſts, eſtabliſhed in the firſt councel of <hi>Nice</hi> the ſaid divinity of Chriſt our Lord, wherein he is conſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to that almighty One who made the earth and ſtars, againſt <hi>Arrius</hi> and his allies, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to teach the contrary, it is incredible to
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:121335:182"/>ſay what frequent murmurations reſorts and conciliar meetings were made afterward up and down the world by the prieſts and byſhops who had drunk in the contrary opinion, and in that point deſerted him, againſt their <hi>Pope</hi> and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour for three or four hundreed years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till in a manner all the whole Church not only clergy but laiety and the princes of Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endom oppoſed him in it, while the Pope now left in a manner alone, or with a very thin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue of beleevers, and all his ſucceſſors one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another fought even to ſweat and blood for the vindication of that great Chriſtian article even againſt the whole world. And he ſo far overcame at length, that there be ſcarcely in theſe dayes any that doubt of that, which the <hi>Pope</hi> only by the authority of his place and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wrought out of the very fire: Whence I may truly ſay that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Popes</hi> God; for if the Pope had not been, or had not been ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and reſolute a paſtour as he is, humanly ſpeaking, Chriſt had not been taken for any ſuch perſon as he is beleeved this day. And let men talk what they will by their vain philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, this I will boldly ſay and am aſſured of, that if the <hi>Pope</hi> be not an unerring guide in matters of religion and faith, all is loſt A man once rid of the controul of his autority may as eaſily deride and as ſolidly confute the incarnation, as the ſprinkling of holy water:
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:121335:183"/>nor could the reaſon of the whole earth be able to convince him.</p>
                  <p>And after all this ſhall children and boyes jeer and revile in our ſtreets and pulpits this ſacred majeſty of the <hi>Pope,</hi> whom the vertue, wit, valour and nobility of all Chriſtendome hath ever ſo highly honoured; and we if we conſider things as we ought can never love too much? ſhall we caſt unjuſt and vile contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies upon him who holding a ſolicitude for all the Churches of Chriſts, has ſo many millions of the greateſt ſpirits in the world depending upon his lips for direction and truth; with whom and under whom have concurred in his general councels ſo many thouſands of renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prelates, venerable byſhops, princely cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, grave patriarchs, ſubtile divines and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, Abbots and Generals of orders, ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, chancellors, knights and barons ſent to his aſſiſtance by the Kings and Potentates of Chriſtendom, the very ſtars of our earthly he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere, met together either to make up or grace and ſtrengthen his great counſell conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſubordination to his legates: nay empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours themſelves have thought it an addition of honour to ſit in that ſolemn and thrice venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſembly, though in a ſeparated place: Shall we I ſay, mock, and revile this ſacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?

<pb n="360" facs="tcp:121335:185"/>beleeved it: That ther be no ſuch things as good works pleaſing to God; but all be as menſtruous rags, filthy, odious and damnable in the ſight of heaven: That if it were otherwis, yet are they not in our power: That with the aſſiſtance of any grace to be had Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements are impoſſible to be kept, and it would be therefor vain to attempt it; eſpecially ſith we have in us no ſtrength of free will to act any thing but evil: That it muſt needs be fooliſhnes to vow unto God, ſith we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing we ought to do, and no leſs fooliſh if we have vowed to pay it: That what wrong ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we do to another, God is merciful and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution fruitles, both becaus one ſin cannot make ſatisfaction for another nor any thing clear us but the blood of Chriſt alone, unto which if we ſhould concurr our ſelves by doing good works or ſatisfying for ill, we ſhould be half our own redeemers: That the Church which preſumes to teach other things than we allow is a fals miſtres, diſtracted, and knows not what ſhe ſayes: That to faſt from ſin is faſt enough, without depriving our ſtomachs of good fleſh when we have a mind to it; and yet becaus we ſin in every thing we do, neither is that faſt poſſible to be kept: That confeſſion is needleſs, <hi>How can man forgive ſins:</hi> That our clergy find themſelvs men and not angells and love women as well as others, and firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:121335:185"/>from popery principally for their ſakes, preferring a good wife before the whore of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, and the altars that kept them aſunder are thrown down, the honeſt pulpit ſtanding now ſolitary ſpeaks for them and brings them happily together: That of indulgencies there is no need, ſince obligation to penalties is ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off long ago by our own autority without any indulgence from another: That papal ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy is the only obſtacle to our liberty, and therefor it muſt be aboliſhed: And let popery hang together as cloſe as it can, it ſhall go hard but we will find a battery to ſhake it.</p>
                  <p>So much indeed hath ſophiſtry and continual clamour againſt <hi>popery,</hi> and ſtate puniſhments lying ever moſt heavily upon the profeſſours of it, prevailed over our judgments that now ther is no goodnes, no worth, no truth in it, no none at all: it is all naught, all and every part of it naught, nothing but naughtines, ſuperſtition and vanity. All that I will ſay for the preſent is this: If <hi>popery</hi> be a bad religion more is the pitty; for the profeſſors of it ſuffer as much for it as might well ſerv for a good one. Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of people for the beleef they have in it and the love they bear its holy counſels and promiſes of future reward, do voluntarily and of their own accord forſake the world and all worldly pleaſures to ſerv God night and day in poverty, humility, and chaſtity: and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:121335:186"/>of others of a ſecular condition in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the earth have rather choſen to live an afflicted life in this world, contemned, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, pillaged, beaten, put to death by their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutours, than to forſake that religion; and theſe too as noble and wiſe perſons many of them as any the earth hath had.</p>
                  <p>But if any will yet be contentious, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his hatred ſtill againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> I earneſtly requeſt he would ſeriouſly ponder theſe few fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Queries</hi> which I borrowed of a friend.</p>

                     <hi>It will not be deny'd but that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>was once a moſt pure, excellent, flouriſhing, and Mother Church; for this is not only by good St.</hi> Paul <hi>amply teſtified in his epiſtle to the ſaid</hi> Romans, <hi>but acknowledged alſo by</hi> Whitaker <hi>in his anſwer to Dr. Sanders, by</hi> White <hi>in his defence of his way, by</hi> Fulk <hi>and</hi> Reinolds; <hi>and alſo by K.</hi> James <hi>in his ſpeech to the Parliament.</hi>

                     <hi>For, it appears ſomwhat ſtrange to me, that a Church ſhould be accounted ſchiſmatical, when ther cannot be aſſigned any other Church different from her, which from age to age, ſince Chriſt his time hath continued viſible, from whence She departed.</hi>

                  <p>If theſe <hi>Queries</hi> were well pondered; or if men would once beleev, as moſt true it is, that by irrefragable principles which all muſt needs acknowledg who will own a Chriſtianity in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, <hi>Popery</hi> may be proved to be as good a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as the beſt, then <hi>Facta eſt Lux.</hi> But this is a little beyond my intention, which aims no further than only to put our paſſions to a demur; for which it may ſuffice us to think that Popery is not ill. And if I ſhould yet ſay more and endeavour to prove it good, thoſe that be of that Way will ſay I ſpeak too little; and they who be not, will think I ſay too much. I had a purpos in the three laſt dialogues of my <hi>Reclaimed Papiſt,</hi> to make Popery appear not only a good religion but the beſt, and not only the beſt but the only ſole Chriſtianity which Chriſt planted upon earth, and which every right reaſon that admits of Chriſt muſt needs approve. But I hope I was therfore diſcouraged and hindred in that work, that it might be left for ſom better hand; and I ſhould my ſelf ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much rejoyce to ſee it don. It is now beſides my purpos, my paper alſo is already too much ſwelled, my mind calls for freedom, and my pen is dulled.</p>

                  <p>AS without the indifferency and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration I have hitherto laboured to implant, ther cannot be in us any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of a right underſtanding: ſo ther be yet ſom moral topicks remaining which are apt to implant this moderation and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency; as to conſider firſt, the ſad precipices men have run themſelves and others by their headineſs and temerarious obſtinacy in their opinions and conceits about religion: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the connatural excellency of a good Chriſtian conſiſts not in finding new waies to the reformation of other mens thoughts, but putting in practis the old received well known dictates of ſobriety, juſtice and piety in our ſelves: thirdly, that charity, which the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle makes to be the end and higheſt perfection of religion and indeed all vertue, ſuggeſts good and moderate thoughts of our neighbour, &amp;c. But theſe and ſuch like topicks be a ſubject fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a pious preacher than a civil logician: and ſo leav them. What I ſhould ſpeak at this
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:121335:188"/>time unto any ſuch purpos, take it in the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den words and phraſe of the honourable Lord Chancellour, the Oratour of the Land.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen, the diſtempers of religion which have too too much diſturbed the peace of this Kingdom is a ſad argument indeed; It is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that muſt make every religious heart to bleed, to ſee religion which ſhould be the ſtrongeſt obligation and cement of affection and brotherly kindneſs and compaſſion, made now by the pervers wranglings of paſſionate and froward men, the ground of all animoſity hatred malice and reveng. And this unruly and unmanly paſſion (which no queſtion the divine nature exceedingly abhors) ſomtimes and I fear too frequently tranſports thoſe who are in the right as well as thoſe who are in the wrong; and leaves the latter more excuſable than the former, when men who find their manners and diſpoſitions very conformable in all the neceſſary obligations of humane nature avoid one anothers converſation, and grow firſt unſociable and then uncharitable to each other; becaus one cannot think as the other doth. And from this ſeparation we intitle God to the patronage of and concernment in our fancies and diſtinction, and purely for his ſake hate one another heartily.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It was not ſo of old when one of the moſt antient Fathers of the Church tells us; that love and charity was ſo ſignal and eminent in the primitive Chriſtians, that it even drew admiration and envy
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:121335:188"/>from their greateſt adverſaries,</hi> Vide, inquiunt ut invicem ſe diligunt. <hi>Their adverſaries in that in which they moſt agreed, in their very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of them had their paſſions and animoſities among themſelvs; they were only Chriſtians that loved and cheriſhed and comforted and were ready to dye for one another.</hi> Quid nunc dicerent illi Chriſtiani ſi noſtra viderent tempora, <hi>ſayes the incomparable Grotius. How would they look upon our ſharp and virulent contentions in the debates of Chriſtian religion and the bloody wars that have proceeded from thoſe contentions, whilſt every one pretended to all the marks which are to attend upon the true Church, except only that which is inſeparable from it, Charity to one another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen. This diſquiſition hath coſt the King many a ſigh many a ſad howr, when he hath conſidered the almoſt irreparable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Proteſtant religion hath undergone from the diviſions and diſtractions which have been ſo notorious within this Kingdom. What pains he hath taken to compoſe them, after ſeveral diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with learned and pious men of different per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions you</hi> may <hi>ſee by a declaration he</hi> hath <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed upon that occaſion by which you ſee his great indulgence to thoſe who can have any protection from conſcience to differ with their brethren. And I hope God will ſo bleſs the candour of his Majeſty in the condeſcentions he makes, that the Church as well as the State will return to that unity and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:121335:189"/>unanimity, which will make both king and people as happy as they can hope to be in this world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If aught yet remain to be ſaid, in the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly words of bleſſed S. Paul I ſhall conclude it all. <hi>Quoſdam quidam poſuit deus,</hi> &amp;c. Some hath God ſet over us in his Church, firſt apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſecondly prophets, thirdly doctours, then virtues, then graces of healing, opitulations, gubernations, ſorts of tongues. Are all apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? are all prophets? are all doctours? are all vertues? have all men the grace of healings? do all ſpeak with tongues? do all interpret? But do you emulate the better graces. And I do yet ſhow unto you a more excelling way. If I ſpeak with the tongues of men and angels, and have not charity I am but as ſounding braſs, and tingling cimbal. And if I ſhall have prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, and know all myſteries and all ſciences and if I ſhall have all faith ſo that I can tranſlate moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and have not charity I am nothing, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This is the great rule of our happines and ſquare of all perfection. <hi>Et quicunque hanc regulam ſecuti fuerint, pax ſuper illos &amp; ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Iſrael Dei.</hi>
